The palace had already been in a state of chaos. The Empress, after a day and a night of struggle, finally gave birth to a baby girl with skin as pink as a jade carving. However, this baby girl did not cry or make any noise, looking at the crowd with a pair of light brown eyes. Holding the Emperor in astonishment, the child was determined to be fine. This child had a faint orchid imprint on her forehead. The small body exudes an ancient scent of orchids. The Emperor rejoiced and gave her the name of “Yue Xin’er”, and the title of “Princess Gu guo.”</p><ul><li>月芯兒 Yuè xīn er: Name, Yue means moon, Xin means heart/core</li><li>固國公主 Gù guó gōngzhǔ: Her title Gu means strong/solid/firm, Guo means country</li></ul><p>~</p><p>A year had passed and not only could Yue Xin’er walk, she could also run. She had a small face with a drunken smile, you can foresee that in the future, she will be a gorgeous woman. Yue Xin’er ran with her feet in front of her, and her two-year-old big sister chasing after her. Perhaps she was heated from the running, there was a thin layer of sweat on her forehead, her face was red, the fragrance exuding from her body was getting stronger. The emperor and empress were pleased with this pair of children, after the birth of Xin’er, they were reluctant to have another child, after all, after having such a daughter, what else can you ask for!</p><p>A servant came forward and whispered something into the Emperor’s ear, and the Emperor’s expression held great joy and stood up to welcome the man who was stepping into the imperial garden. The man was dressed in white, he seemed about 40 years old, he had a friendly appearance, an aura of an immortal and his posture was not of the mundane world.</p><p>“Yun Zhongzi, You are finally willing to meet with Zhen?” The rejoicing expression on the Emperor’s face, it seems that his relationship with this person is very profound.</p><ul><li>雲中子 Yún zhōng zǐ: A name, Yun means cloud</li><li>朕 Zhèn: How an Emperor refers to himself</li></ul><p>However, the person’s face was very clear, he not like to see other people’s pretending gestures, saying: “How can pin dao dare, Your Majesty is very busy, can you blame it on Yun Zhongzi?”</p><ul><li>貧道 Pín dào: How someone who devotes their life to god,&nbsp;Taoist, or Buddhism would refer to themselves, it also means this impoverished one</li></ul><p>The Emperor smiled a bit and suddenly shot up and attacked Yun Zhongzi, after a flash Yun Zhongzi was a few yards away. Once again, the Emperor set forth his palm, but he did not even manage touch his clothes. Two people fought back and forth, the plum blossoms in the imperial garden floated down like a scene from heaven. After a while, the Emperor stopped and sighed: “I did not think your martial arts would progress so fast. I can’t even touch your clothes.”</p><p>Yun Zhongzi smiled: “You already have the position of Emperor, why do you want to play as such?”</p><p>The two good friends smiled.</p><p>Not far away there is a small figure, looking at the two men, she opened her hands towards the Emperor, and her mouth murmured: “Imperial father, hug!”</p><p>The Emperor accepted the soft doll-like child and showed his kindness. The royal ruthlessness, how many royals and their grandchildren have lost the affection that ordinary people can enjoy in a palace that eats people without throwing out the bones. Yun Zhongzi looked at the little girl in front of his eyes and nodded while stroking his beard. “This is the Princess of the country. She really is a dragon and a phoenix. Her future is bound to be endless.”</p><p>Somewhat strangely watching Yun Zhongzi, : “I have never heard you say such things when you first saw Feng’er and Qiang’er. I have never seen you praise someone as such, what is it today?”</p><p>“Hahaha, Your Majesty, could you be jealous of the little Princess?” Yun Zhongzi asked.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The Emperor’s face turned a bit red he felt shameful, his wife next to him was also the same way, they both didn’t have any face, “Who says I was jealous? I just found it strange.” It seems the Emperor was a bit shy.</p><p>“Yes, yes, you were not.” When Yun Zhongzi likes something, he will accept it, he only deliberately pretended to be perfunctory, he saw the little girl staring at him, stretching her little hands to hug him. He gave a glimpse then an unpredictable laugh and took a look at the little Princess who was like pink jade, and quietly told her: “Little Princess, from now on you will be my disciple okay?”</p><p>Yue Xin’er wrinkled her small jade-like nose, her pair of phoenix eyes stared at him, she stuck out her tongue, sniffed at him and nodded. Yun Zhongzi was dumbstruck by these actions, and gave a laugh, “This doll-like girl is very interesting.”</p><p>Yue Xin’er also giggled at the sight, her laughter was like that of silver bells, crisp and sweet. After a while, Yue Xin’er suddenly ceased laughing, and cried, “Master”. Yun Zhongzi smiled more openly and straightly praised: “Truly a goddess ah!”</p><p>Later, Yun Zhongzi notified the Emperor by saying: “Xin’er is not an ordinary person but is descended from the heavens, she will have to go to the mountains to practice. In the future, she will be able to protect the country’s well being.”</p><p>Although the Emperor was anxious, he still reluctantly sent Yue Xin’er to Xiyun Mountain.</p><ul><li>汐雲 Xī yún: Name of the Mountain</li></ul>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p><p>The sky is bright, within the bamboo forest, there is a melodious song. Walking towards the end of the trail, a faint orchid scent seemed to permeate through the mist, one could vaguely see a figure of a young woman dressed in a snowy white dress, wearing a white belt embroidered with orchid tied around her waist playing the guzheng. Her long black hair flows smoothly down to the waist, shining faintly like satin. There are no ornaments in her hair, there was only a white silver headband fluttering in the wind. After the completion of one song, the sun has risen and the fog has gradually dispersed. The sun shines through the mist and onto the woman, her chest glows with a blue light.</p><p>She was scrutinizing what she was wearing on her chest, it was an orchid brooch, made of rare blue crystals. Looking closely, there was a faint orchid imprint on the young woman’s forehead, her phoenix eyes were narrow and deep, with a pale purple light. She had eyelashes that were long and thick, and a small upright nose that was accompanied by small cherry-like lips, her snow like cheeks showed a natural reddish appearance. Her exposed collar revealed a part of her jade-like neck, she had an expression of calmness. As beautiful as a goddess who could not be touched by a speck of dust.</p><p>Looking into the depths of the bamboo forest, she lightly said: “Master, was your disciple’s piece of 《Autumn Water》pleasing to the ears?”</p><ul><li>《秋水》Qiūshuǐ: Autumn water, a song played on the guzheng, an instrument, it is a real song</li></ul><p>After a burst of laughter, a middle-aged man with the aura of an immortal came out, “Not bad, Xin’er’s qin skills have gone a step further, even the music from the owner of the world’s number one qin, Huangfu Changtian, is not as good as you.”</p><p>Yue Xin’er’s lips slightly curled at the corners, there is an aura pressing down, causing people to be unable to open their eyes. “Master, you did not come to this bamboo forest to only listen to your disciple play the qin, right?”</p><p>Yun Zhong Zi sighed, “You little girl, you will soon be fifteen, during this time you should get ready to return to the palace to take a look. Your master really doesn’t understand you.”</p><p>She lowered her head, her eyes were red, the breeze blew bamboo leaves toward her body, making her look even more ethereal.</p><p>“Xin’er, master does not worry about your safety, you established the Crescent Moon Palace when you were ten years old, there are the seven gate keepers protecting you, even your master does not dare underestimate you. You also have medical skills, the title of ‘Goddess Medical Doctor’, you are full of talent. This time when you leave the mountains to travel the four seas, you must take care of yourself. Your master doesn’t have anything to gift to you other than this ‘mysterious book of heaven’, it is a gift from master to you. Remember ‘Do not be happy with objects, do not be sad.’ Then Yun Zhong Zi took out a yellow book from his sleeves and gave it to her.</p><ul><li>新月宮 Xīn yuègōng: Crescent Moon Palace, or New Moon Palace; a sect of some sorts</li><li>玄妙天書 Mysterious/mystical book of heaven; most likely a martial arts manual</li></ul><p>“Thank you, master.” Yue Xin’er showed her gratitude, she was curious about the contents of this mysterious book.</p><p>Yun Zhong Zi couldn’t help but laugh when he saw her whole heartily immersed in the mystical book of heaven. This little girl, she obviously still has a child’s nature, for the sake of the world, he made her the way she was, he did not know whether it was by luck or unfortunate.</p><p>Since thirteen years ago, when they had ascended the mountains Yun Zhong Zi had her go through self-cultivation. For a two-year-old doll-like girl, it is natural for her to be active. It was cruel for her to calm down and learn how to cultivate her body. He often saw the small figure of Yue Xin’er, she was a child, but stubbornly refused to bow to him. Sometimes he saw her longing eyes looking toward the path that led down the mountain, he secretly thought to himself that if she had begged him, perhaps he would take her down the mountains for the lantern festival. But she never asked for anything, only wishing to go pick herbs, she silently carried the medicine and went to the Qiqiu Valley, the place that makes the people of the jianghu eager to go. After returning, she had gained a little white tiger. When she was nine years old, she was very alluring, just one gaze of her’s could take away a man’s heart and mind. She was renowned with Zheng Sulan who was sixteen at the time they were known as “The duo of medicine gods”.</p><ul><li>七絕穀 Qiqiu Valley: Very dangerous, but people still go there for a chance to gain power</li><li>江湖 Jiānghú: Rivers and lakes; the pugilistic world in the Wuxia/martial arts genre</li><li>鄭素蘭 Zheng Sulan: a name, Zheng being the surname, Su meaning plain, and Lan mean orchid</li></ul><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>As he expected, her temper was cold as jade but not as cold as ice, she just treated everything with indifference. This is the realm he wanted her to be in —— the body as water, the heart as water. When she was ten, she descended the mountain with the seven boys and girls that she had carefully cultivated with and established the largest sect in the jianghu, the crescent moon palace. But no matter what, he never saw her with any expressions. Looking at those eyes that haven’t had any ripples in them for a long time other than due to the mysterious book of heaven, he did not know if he was in the right or in the wrong. This girl that only feels sadness and pity, he is afraid that everything will be out of control when she leaves the mountains!</p><p>If Yun Zhong Zi did not feel the fluctuations of the heart and sit quietly to look through the mysterious book of heaven. She didn’t know that her master’s heart was turning with such thoughts, she couldn’t blame him, as she didn’t have a choice, she also knew that master did it for her own good. She never asked him to take her down the mountains to play because she knew she had an extremely important identity, although she was a child, her mind had already surpassed mortal bounds. She knew that master had pity her and wanted to spoil her, but she could not let herself go and let herself relaxed, because she was responsible for the rise and fall of the country, and imperial father had already passed down her edict to seal her up as a goddess.</p><p>She is afraid that she will have to govern the country together with her imperial brother. But she does not wish to! If she was an ordinary woman, she does not have to bear so much responsibility! At the age of six, Master let her go to Qiqiu Valley, perhaps she was hesitant in her heart, after all, it was pernicious all year round, it was poisonous everywhere, even the birds did not dare to fly in. Many of the elixirs that people of jianghu dreamed of had all come out of this place. For centuries, the people who entered and were able to come out have been few in number. But she still agreed without wrinkling her eyebrows, at that time, she felt that master’s heart had been hit by a storm, he merely wanted her to beg for mercy, in his heart he already had a place for her.</p><p>After returning, she was followed by a white tiger that she saved in Qiqiu Valley, the little guy had strayed into the valley and gotten poisoned. Luckily, Yue Xin’er was there and he had survived. She also didn’t know why she was able to come back safely, maybe there was a mysterious force protecting her! Before she was ten years old, her master was always urging her to go down the mountains, to treat people’s illnesses. Due to her age, the people did not dare to let her diagnose them, but soon, when she cured the village chief’s persistent illness, one after another, the villagers began to seek medical advice from her.</p><p>After a small experiment with the knife, she did not want to cure a few minor illnesses, she then singled out incurable diseases and later learned to make poison and detoxification. During this time, she saved seven orphans that were older than her, healed them and took them to the mountains after curing their poisons. The seven people had their gratitude for her life-saving grace, and are determined to repay her. After hearing their sincerity she gave them a secret martial arts manual and also taught them different techniques when she was ten years old she let them leave the mountain and tasked them with establishing the Crescent Moon palace. The imperial palace was too far away, and she was often unable to handle its affairs, but the matters of jianghu, she allowed her older brothers to manage it.</p><p>Originally, she did not have much expectations for the seven people, who knows it was unintentional. Today’s Crescent moon palace is held in regard as the world’s number one sect for both the black and white sides of the jianghu, its forces have been extended to officials and businessmen, and casually rubbing a foot can cause the entire Jingyue Dynasty to tremble. She does not like politics but she was dragged into this circle because of her brother’s words, today more than half of the military power is in their hands, if she had the ambition to become the emperor, even her imperial elder brother will not wrinkle his brow, and give the throne to her! In addition, the founding emperor of the Jingyue Dynasty, Goddess of the Moon was a woman, there was no worry about women interfering with politics.</p><ul><li>Black and white sides; Black being the dark/evil side of jianghu, and white being the light/good side of jianghu</li><li>靜月王朝 Jìng yuè wángcháo: Jingyue Imperial Dynasty; Jing means quiet/calm/tranquil, and Yue means moon</li></ul><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Some time ago, older sister Yue Ling left the palace, she left after taking care of the matter with brother-in-law in the cold northern dessert. I had already guessed that my older brother would not promise Yue Ling to him, so he left a letter to sister Yi, Zheng Sulan’s sister-in-law, threatening the Emperor that if he does not agree, he would hide the armory in the mountains. When the emperor heard, he dared not disregard his beautiful and intelligent younger sister who held a lot of power, he then arranged the marriage, and his young sister was relieved.</p><ul><li>月翎 Yuè líng: Moonlight; Name of Yue Xin’er’s older sister</li></ul><p>This month, Yue Xin’er is about to come of age, as the goddess of a country, her status is equal to that of an Emperor, how can it not be held in high regard? Therefore, when she returned to the palace, she was dragged for measuring her dress size, and she was asked what jewelry she preferred, when she shook her head and refused, she terrified a group of people, thinking that she was dissatisfied, they kneeled and begged for their lives.</p><p>When Zheng Sulan came, she saw that the Heart Moon Palace was in disarray, and the culprit is standing aside with a slight frown. Everyone saw the Empress and bowed, calling: “Greetings to the Empress, may your majesty live for thousands and thousands of years.” She waved her hand and allowed them to get up, but no one dared to stand up, this couldn’t help but make her feel weird. “Xin’er, what is going on?”</p><p>“I am also unsure, you should ask them!?”</p><p>When the Empress could not get a word from the girl’s mouth, she knew that this girl was never concerned about anything, so she turned around and asked those in the room.</p><p>Among them, there was a pretty maiden, whose status was not low replied: “Replying to Empress, these slaves were preparing for the princess’s grand ceremony, we presented a lot of jewelry, but the princess is not satisfied. This slave thought princess wanted to punish these slaves, we do not dare…”</p><p>One could see that Yue Xin’er’s eyebrows wrinkled even more, but there was no expression that could be seen beneath that veiled face. The Empress saw that Yue Xin’er refuse to speak, she had to explain, “You all misunderstood. The little princess did not want to punish you. She is dissatisfied because she never wears any jewelry besides ‘Fragrant Orchid of the Secluded Valley’ You guys think it over if that is the case?”</p><p>Those people listened, and they were bold enough to look at her. There was nothing other than the brochette worn on her chest, even her hair was just as soft as silver silk satin.</p><p>“Good, now that you have seen enough, get up! If this spreads, people will say that the Princess place blame on the servants.” Zheng Sulan pretended to be angry, and those people got up. Then said to Yue Xin’er: “Xin’er, the grand ceremony is different from other festivals, it only happens once in a lifetime, can you stand before the officials, or pick some jewelry that you like!”</p><p>Yue Xin’er thought for a moment, and nodded “When the time comes, I’ll make my own decisions, take these items away! At the time of the ceremony, the family’s dignity will not be lost.”</p><p>Seeing that she had promised, the Empress no longer forced her, knowing that she had the innate knowledge and that these common items could not enter her eyes.</p><p>When it comes to this righteous sister, she has never seen her true face, every time she sees her, she would either be wearing a veil or a human skin mask. The reason she can be with the Emperor is because of her, it can be said that she was their matchmaker. Because Yue Xin’er often cultivates in mount Jinyun, they rarely see each other, it was due to an accident that they became sisters, later, because of this relationship that she successfully climbed to this relation, the relationship between the two people became more intimate. She could never see through her, even her brother, sister, and master couldn’t understand what she was thinking. She could be considered fortunate, generally the children of the imperial are to be married, however, because of her status, no one even dares to mention engagements before her, could such a goddess be someone that a mortal would be able to match?</p><p>“Huang Sao, why don’t you return first, otherwise imperial brother will come here for you.”</p><ul><li>皇嫂 Huáng sǎo: Huang means imperial, sao means elder brother’s wife; Imperial sister in law</li></ul><p>She got an answer that was laced with blame, “You little girl, you still have the mind to ridicule me, next time I will bring Yu’er to see you, you should make preparations!”</p><ul><li>煜 Yù: a name, it means brilliant/glorious</li></ul><p>Yu’er? Yue Xin’er thought it had been a long time since she saw him, she really wants to see him sooner.</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

Because Yue Xin’er is a goddess, she must be at the altar. The altar can only be used by goddesses of the past, in addition to holding the ceremony outside, there would be stargazing, divination and worship of ancestors. This is a supreme honor for a woman, and also reflects the woman’s status in the Jingyue Kingdom, although it is not a female dominated society, both men and women are considered equal in terms of status.</p><p>To be honest, if her identity was not related to the fate of the world, she would not be willing to appear in front of the people, let alone on her fifteenth birthday. After completing the cumbersome ceremonial rituals, she stepped down from the altar, there was still a feeling of dazzling, which made her feel the heavy responsibility on her shoulders, she felt helpless.</p><p>The clothing on her body was extremely decorated and full of bright colors when she walked past there was a lingering fragrance left behind. Wealth is not my wish, but this feeling will be used as “A full man does not know the hungry man during a famine.” Still covered with a veil, which covered the appearance of inconvenience, but it could not cover her attitude as if she was not of the mundane world.</p><ul><li>飽汗不知餓漢饑: A full man does not know the hungry man during a famine; when the other perspective is not worried about or cared for</li></ul><p>She was about to go to Yuehui Palace when she was interrupted by a palace maid. The palace maid bowed, and said: “Princess, the Emperor wants you to go to Yuelan Palace right away.”</p><p>“Oh? What’s the matter?” Yue Xin’er raises her eyebrows, why did he need to use the two words ‘right away’? Could it be the sky is falling today?</p><ul><li>Could it be the sky is falling today: means not usual, kind of similar to the sun rising from the west; it is an expression</li></ul><p>“This slave does not know, Princess, please come with this slave to Yuelan Palace.” The palace maid never lifted her head from beginning to end, with a humble appearance.</p><p>She glanced at this palace maid, who she had never seen before, the corners of her mouth bent into a distinctive curve, “Then, you lead the way!”</p><p>The palace maid turns and leads the way in front, Yue Xin’er follows behind neither too slow nor too fast, she suddenly asks: “What time is it now?”</p><p>“Replying to Princess, it is Shen shi.”</p><ul><li>申時 Shēn shí: 4 pm to 6 pm, an ancient Chinese measurement of time</li></ul><p>“Oh, is it so?” She thought for a moment and stopped, “I don’t have time to play with you.”</p><p>The palace maid pauses, her body stiffens, she puts on an unsightly smile, “This slave does not understand Princess’ meaning.”</p><p>Yue Xin’er also gives a smile as her eyes brighten, “You really don’t understand? Brother-in-law’s junior sister, Wen Meixia, miss Wen.”</p><ul><li>溫美霞 Wen Meixia: Her older sister’s husband’s junior sister</li></ul><p>“How did you know I was Wen Meixia?” Since she has been exposed, there is no need to continue pretending.</p><p>“I need you to know, not only in medicine, my disguise skills are also number one in the world, up till now, no one has been able to recognize the people I have disguised. And you, I knew your identity the moment you approached me.”</p><p>“Haha, I was seen through by you! I originally thought to kill you to avenge my father, now…”</p><p>There was a smile on her face, and sarcasm in her eyes “You really think you can kill me? I originally promised your father if you did not seek revenge I would spare your life, and now you’ve come into the palace to assassinate me.” The silver bells from her bracelet on her wrist rang a few times, and in the blink of an eye, two people had appeared. “Zi Yuan, you take care of this. Qing Niao, follow me to Yuehui palace.” They immediately left, leaving Zi Yuan and Wen Meixia who were prepared for battle.</p><p>In the time of less than an incense stick, Zi Yuan returned to Yue Xin’er’s side. “Palace Lord, the matter has been taken care of.”</p><ul><li>Palace Lord (宫主) as in the master of Crescent Moon palace, and not the imperial palace (公主), even though both are pronounced as Gong Zhu</li></ul><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Bury her next to her father!

I let you kill her because Qing Niao is a man, he is not suitable to kill a woman, this type of responsibility is something a man does not wish to take responsibility for.” Yue Xin’er explained expressionlessly, but it made Zi Yuan feel gratitude.</p><p>When they arrived at Yuehui Palace, the sky was already dark, but inside Yuehui Palace it was brightly lit, like a white pagoda. Once she entered, there was a pair of noble and elegant couples sitting in the grand hall, along with Yu Yuefeng and Yue Ling, a husband, and wife.</p><p>“Er’chen greets imperial father, mother.” Before she looked up, she had already been embraced by a middle-aged lady.</p><p>“Haotian, look, Xin’er has grown up. Look at this snow white skin. This charming figure is three points better than Xi Shi.”</p><ul><li>Xi Shi, is one of the four beauties of ancient China, she lived during the spring and autumn period, caused the downfall of an empire (State of Wu), she is said to be so beautiful that fish would forget to swim</li></ul><p>“Okay, Qing’er, you have yet to see Xin’er’s face, if outsiders heard that, they would laugh, saying ‘Auntie Wang sells melons, boasting what you’re selling’.” said the middle-aged man, who was Yue Xin’er’s father.</p><ul><li>Auntie Wang sells melons, boasting what you’re selling: Means bragging; in this case, bragging about the beauty of one’s own daughter</li></ul><p>Feng Yuqing did not agree, “What do you mean, I can be said to be a beauty ah, how much worse can my daughter be? What’s more, when Xin’er was little she was like a little doll, do you really think she would grow up to be ugly? Who would dare say my Xin’er is ugly, I will be anxious!” Finished speaking, she gave Yue Haotian an angry glare.</p><ul><li>月昊天 Yuè hào tiān: Yue Xin’er’s father; Grand Emperor</li><li>鳳玉青 Fèng yùqīng: Yue Xin’er’s mother; Grand Empress</li></ul><p>“Fine, consider it my wrong!” Yue Haotian said helplessly.</p><p>“Hump, you are the one who is wrong!” For Yue Haotian, this wife of his is very laughable at times, in his life it could be considered very joyful. Those from the Yue family line could be said to stay true to one person, in this lifetime he could have such a wife, that gave him a son, and two daughters, life as such, what can a husband ask for?</p><p>Yue Xin’er was standing with Yue Ling, chatting with each other, she was too lazy to deal with the bickering couple, playing tricks all day, and yet they do not get annoyed.</p><p>“My precious Xin’er, take down your veil and let imperial mother see!” Feng Yuqing’s voice caused Yue Xin’er and the people in the room to feel goosebumps creeping up all over their bodies.</p><p>Taking a few steps back for safety, she really does not know how imperial father endured her for so long. “Imperial mother, this…” Yue Xin’er said with some embarrassment.</p><p>Feng Yuqing looked at her with a puzzled look. “What is it?” Is it that she, as a mother cannot see her own daughter’s appearance?</p><p>Seeing Xin’er’s face showing some trouble, Yue Tianhao said to her: “Qing’er, have you forgotten? Before Xin’er can find her true love, she cannot let anyone other than Yun Zhongzi see her true appearance?”</p><p>It dawned on her that when Yun Zhongzi said that Xin’er was a goddess, she shouldered the rise and fall of the country, so she was brought to the mountains for education. It was also said that after she was ten years old, she would not be able to show her true face, unless she finds one who is destined to be with her, otherwise, there will be a big calamity. “Xin’er, you don’t have to worry, let’s go eat.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>For a time, the atmosphere of Yuehui palace was very good. Who said that the royal family was heartless?</p><p>It was almost Xu shi by the time she returned to Yuexin Palace, she was followed by a few servants who were holding gifts from her loved ones in their hands. There was a variety of gifts, including Nanhai Black Pearl, Donghai Red Coral, Tianshan snow lotus, and the Millennium He Shou Wu. The tables and cabinets in the palace are valuable, they were gifts from ministers and friends, as well as treasures sent from other countries, just seeing it made people dazzled.</p><ul><li>Xu shi: time, 8pm-10pm [Nanhai: South Ocean/Sea], [Donghai: East Ocean/Sea], [Tianshan: Sky Mountain]</li></ul><p>Suddenly, an item on the eastern footer attracted her attention. It was a box carved with Lan Tian jade, on the surface of the box was a pattern of a pair of dragons playing with beads, the box was covered, and a double heart lock hangs outside, carefully locking the box. Yue Xin’er smiled, such a refined box should have been sent by the Tianxiang Kingdom? “Whose gift is this from?”</p><p>A palace maid answered: “Replying to Princess, it was sent by the grand prince of Tianxiang Kingdom.”</p><p>“Oh.” As expected, the Tianxiang Kingdom and the Jingyue Kingdom are two neighboring countries and have maintained friendly relations with each other. The current Empress of Tianxiang Kingdom is her aunt, although this grand prince is not born from her aunt, according to relations he is her cousin! Opening the double heart clasp, there is a pair of hollow carved crystal balls, one large, about four centimeters in diameter, there is a pink pearl inside, there are many small hollow holes in the ball. Yue Xin’er’s eyes brightened, this is suitable for her own weapon, she took a white ribbon from her sleeve and pushed it with internal force, the ball gave off a sweet clink sound. Satisfied with a smile, she took the ribbon back into her sleeve, when it is empty she could put medicine into it, but until then it would be an incredible weapon. Looking at the ball again, the shape and structure of the ball is almost the same as that of the big ball, the diameter is about two centimeters, inside the ball it was purple, after careful observation, it was found that inside the sphere with a diameter of one centimeter, it contained a white orchid, there was a lingering fragrance of orchid surrounded by small spheres. The ball was strung on a silver chain, the chain did not seem to be made of silver, it was more like platinum.</p><p>“Shan’er, come and help me put it on.”</p><p>Shan’er next to her carefully took the sphere and put it on her neck, at that moment, her eyes were dazzled.</p><p>“Princess, you look so beautiful.” The people praised with sincerity, they had thought that the Empress and Princess Yue Ling were beautiful, although they had not seen the true face of the little Princess, her elegance and her charm than none could resist were deeply convincing.</p><p>Yue Xin’er’s face under the veil became slightly red from embarrassment: “It is late, you all retreat to rest first!”</p><p>“But Princess, you have not yet rested, how can this slave go first?” Shan’er said.</p><p>“No need, I have to stay late for a while.You go ahead, I want to be alone for a while.”</p><p>“Yes, Princess, this slave will retreat.” Shan’er took a group of people out and closed the door.</p><p>Seeing that everyone left, Yue Xin’er looked at other gifts, almost all of them were jewels, only the gifts from the seven main gates can enter her eyes.</p><p>Sitting on the couch, she touched the sphere around her neck and stared out the window. It was already late at night, the palace should have had many guards patrolling because she had always been a light sleeper, she worried she would be awakened by their footsteps, so she gave an order for them to keep their distance from her palace.</p><p>Strange, this grand prince has no connection to her, and is not really her cousin, why would he give her such a precious gift? These two balls are not just simple ornaments. It is said that they are two teardrops a heavenly fairy had shed for the world, they landed in Kunming Lake and were later acquired by a craftsman, who made them into what they are now. The world only knows that this object is priceless, but does not know of its use. The large one is Bing Xin pearl, the small one is called Lei Lan pearl, right now both items are in her hands.</p><ul><li>冰心珠 Bing Xin Zhu: Bing means ice, Xin means heart</li><li>淚蘭珠 Lei Lan Zhu: Lei means tears, Lan means orchid</li></ul><p>After thinking about it, she did not have a clue.

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>Chapter 3 Part 1</strong></p><p>On this day, the sky was clear, the three children of the Yue family along with the Grand Emperor and Grand Empress went to the imperial garden, together. It was currently springtime, flowers were at the peak of bloom while the bees and butterflies are busy gathering nectar. Yue Xin’er took out a small porcelain bottle to gather the flower’s dew, while the others sat in the pavilion savoring Yue Xin’er’s original ‘Moon wind floss’. The dew was from the first day of spring, Yue Xin’er would use it for refining to make hundred flowers wine. The undisturbed appearance of the dust is a little thin in face of the sun, it feels like the sun’s rays and a gust of wind could easily blow it away. This was a pleasant morning, but such peace was broken due to the intrusion of a voice.</p><p>At a certain distance, a minister stood by a stone table, reporting a matter to Yue Feng. Yue Xin’er was able to see his frown. She handed the porcelain bottle to the maid next to her, allowing them to continue to talk among themselves, as she walked towards the stone table.</p><ul><li>月楓 Yue Feng: Current Emperor, the son of the Grand Emperor who abdicated the throne, and is living a carefree life (He pushed everything onto his son)</li></ul><p>“Imperial brother, what’s the matter?” Although Yue Xin’er did not like politics but seeing him so worried, she feared a major event such as a natural disaster has occurred!</p><p>“Xin’er, You came in time! The Luo River flooded the southern area and submerged it. It also caused a plague. In recent days, due to the attack of the Qing City, all the food and supplies were given to the army. Nowadays, the domestic food supply is insufficient. In addition, a number of doctors have been transferred to support the army. It is also lacking in medicine, with food shortages, and the lack of medical doctors ah! ”</p><p>As soon as she heard him, the beautiful lady frowns at him, what she then said was colder than ice, “This is great, you didn’t discuss with me and dared to send troops to Jing Lou Pass without authorization, as of now the state treasury is empty, where do you place the common people?”</p><p>Yue Feng wiped the cold sweat on his forehead, and gave a glance toward Yue Haotian as if begging for help&nbsp;while groaning in his heart, how could she still have more momentum than me? “That’s not it, you once said that you liked Qing City, I wanted to win it and give it to you as a birthday gift, who knew…”</p><p>“Is this an excuse you can use? Preposterous!” Yue Xin’er waved her sleeve, and the people around dare not speak. “Let it pass, I will deal with this matter, tomorrow I will go to Southern Wei, during this time you must deal with it properly, otherwise…”</p><p>Really did not have face, ah, this Emperor was really useless, when he heard her intimidation he dare not mess up. But this was also his willingness, after all, this little sister has been much better than Yue Ling, and with her help, these days have been much more comfortable.</p><p>After bidding farewell to her family, Yue Xin’er brought the four gatekeepers, Chi Wu, Cheng Feng, Zi Yuan, Qing Niao on the boat bound for Southern Wei. Only some herbs were on board, while the rest of the herb and food were taking the land route. She did not intend to bring too much, she prepared to use Crescent Moon Palace’s token to gather herbal supplies from the local medicinal shops after arriving at Southern Wei. Then let Chi Wu report to the godly doctor’s Gate, so that all the people under the Gate would rush to Southern Wei.</p><ul><li>Godly doctor’s gate: also a sect, like Crescent moon palace, but filled with people who are adept in medicine</li></ul><p>The sky was a bit gloomy and depressing, experienced sailors knew that a big storm was coming. Yue Xin’er stood on the bow of the boat, holding something in her hands while thinking, she gave orders to the four Gatekeepers. The sails have come down, and the seas are rough and swaying. A flash of lightning flashed over the horizon, and then only loud thunder was heard, heavy downpours began and the ship shook even more.</p><p>“Listen, if something happens, don’t panic. I will not die. You must go to Southern Wei according to your original plan. I will go to Ji Province to join you.” Yue Xin’er calmly stated that the storm did not worry her, she could not die so easily, her task has yet to be completed, the Heavens would not take her back so easily.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The four people looked at each other with a dignified face, they clasped their fists and said: “This subordinate obeys the orders, we will try our best to solve the difficulties of Southern Wei.”</p><p>As soon as their voice fell, a big wave hit, Yue Xin’er was hit by the wave and carried into the ocean, her figure soon disappeared, the remaining four finally managed to stabilize their bodies, and looked up to find that Yue Xin’er has disappeared. “Master, master…” At one time, the sea was full of shouts, accompanied by thunder and rain, the sounds eventually died down. Yue Xin’er was immersed in water for a long time, she began to swim hard, in the end, she got exhausted and fainted, drifting in the sea.</p><p><strong>Chapter 3 Part 2</strong></p><p>~</p><p>Originally she thought she had died, who knew that when she opened her eyes, she found that she was in a familiar cabin, similar to one she had lived before. Her entire body felt an unspeakable soreness, it seems this storm was really strong. Yue Xin’er was about to get up when the door suddenly opened, and a handsome young man came in with a bowl of medicine. Seeing that she was awake, the young man’s eyes curved like the bright moon, he quickly went to support her.</p><p>“Miss, you have awoken.” The man sat on the edge of the bed and smiled like a spring flower, as a child under the sun, it made a person’s heart warm up. His laugh felt like it had a hint of evil, with elegance.</p><p>“Who are you? DId you save me?” Yue Xin’er felt a bit strange, she felt that he was somehow familiar, but she could not think of where. Only his temperament, gave people a cynical feeling, but it is currently not showing.</p><p>The man said with a smile: “I am Mu Tianchen, I am the one who saved you” Then he glanced at her again, “But the clothes on your body were not changed by me.”</p><p>“You…” Yue Xin’er blushed, she pushed back the quilt to take a look, her clothes really have been changed, she then realized that the veil was no longer on her face. “No matter what, thank you, gongzi, for your life-saving grace.”</p><p>Mu Tianchen saw her blush, she was tender and pleasant, he stared at her for a while, it was a long time before he recovered, she was truly a stunning beauty! “I dare ask Miss’ name?”</p><p>Yue Xin’er looked at him with vigilance, although he was her savior, because of her special status, she would not allow herself to become a tool for others to threaten Jingyue Kingdom, therefore, she seldom told others her real name. After some consideration, she decided to tell him her real name, just that her surname is too special, she feared everyone would know her identity, so she only said her name was ‘Xin’er’. In her heart, she felt that Mu Tianchen would not hurt her, so she did not have her guard up around him.</p><p>The two talked for a while, Yue Xin’er knows that he is a merchant because he was on his way to the TianXiang Kingdom when he met with the storm, he saw her in the water and saved her, he also got someone to change her clothes. In fact, Yue Xin’er did not believe him, a merchant would not have the aura of a king, and his name reminds her of something she came across recently. However, since he refused to speak, then she did not ask, she believes that he has his own ideas! She did not tell him the truth as well. They could be considered equal. Only this appearance was actually seen by him, if something happened, she feared that he would not be able to place blame on her. So she asked him to find a veil to cover her face, but he rejected, and she had to tell her own difficulties to him. Even though he knew, he said: “It’s nonsense, you have been seen by me, and you want to cover your face, maybe it is better for me to be with you!”</p><p>After lying in bed for two days, her body finally recovered, she stretched and opened the door to walk out. It was noisy at the moment she opened the door. Everyone was shocked by her unique beauty, such god-like holiness, a white dress that looked like a fairy, a pair of crystal-like eyes, and an orchid imprint on her forehead, the whole person seems to be with a hint of charm with pure coldness. Her beauty could move a person’s heart and make a person feel as if they were in heaven, she seemed to have walked out of a painting.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Mu Tianchen felt regret, he should not have let her come out without wearing a veil, her shocking beauty would make everyone fall in love with her. At that moment, he felt that she would go with the wind and disappear from the world forever, so he hurriedly reached out and held her.</p><p>“Don’t go, Xin’er.” Mu Tianchen buried his head in her jade neck, as his lips whispered into her earlobe.</p><p>He never thought Yue Xin’er would push him on the board and take a few steps back to the side. Mu Tianchen did not expect Yue Xin’er to have such a reaction and was caught off guard. Looking at the beautiful woman again, her face was red, she looked at him with anger and annoyance. He couldn’t help but feel happy, this little girl really didn’t have a deep understanding of the world, seeing her shyness made one feel love and pity.</p><p>“Oh, Xin’er, I’ve fallen to death, are you trying to murder your husband?” Mu Tianchen turned his train of thought, he gave a look of being wronged to see how she would react, who knew she did not spare him a glance and walked back to her room. When Mu Tianchen saw her ignore him, he quickly got up, gave a wide smile and went in with her.</p><p>Yue Xin’er closed the door, leaving him outside, no matter how noisy he was she still refused to open the door, perhaps if he waited for a while, he would grow bored and leave. Thinking back, the scene of Mu Tianchen embracing her was on her mind, there was a strange feeling in her, it made her heart beat wildly and uncontrollably. Heavens, what happened to me? Did I my cultivation deviate to the demons? She closed her eyes, but the scene was now even clearer. She silently recited the《Jin Gang Sutra》, her mind becomes clearer, perhaps she should not get involved with him that much, after all, they got to know each other through a coincidence. Besides, it was imperative that they go to Southern We first, the people are awaiting salvation! She secretly made a decision, once they arrived in Southern Wei, she would part ways with him!</p><ul><li>《Jin Gang Sutra》: Buddhist scripture used to calm the heart and mind when recited</li></ul><p>Looking at Mu Tianchen, when he enters the room, he realizes that she has suddenly intruded on the beauty, and he is afraid she will be there to discipline him. When he thinks of the beauty’s faint scent, his heart couldn’t help but skip a beat. He was not the type of person to fall in love with beauty, it was just certain factors, and gestures that confused him, he truly hugged her involuntarily. It seems that her charm really cannot be underestimated, it is no wonder that people would feel respect towards her.</p><p>On the other side, because Yue Xin’er had gotten swept away by the wave, her followers were worried, they left a ship and continued to search for her on the sea, the other boats were taken towards Southern Wei, they also got Crescent Moon Palace to help search. Although they were worried about her safety&nbsp;when they thought about what she had said at the beginning, she had a love for the people of her Kingdom, she was ready to go to Southern Wei to help the victims of natural disaster.</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>Chapter 4</strong></p><p>Three days later, when the ship was arriving to shore, a group of black clothed people suddenly descended from the sky, they did not say a word and pulled out their swords to attack. Mu Tianchen hid Yue Xin’er in the cabin and with his men, they crossed swords with the enemy.</p><p>“Hmm, I wonder how he’s doing.” Because she did not know the extent of Mu Tianchen’s martial arts, and she was worried as he locked her in the cabin. However, thinking about it, with his high status, he should have learned martial arts well, his subordinates will also desperately protect him, therefore she was not anxious, instead, she felt a trace of leisure, she can sit down and slowly savor a cup of tea.</p><p>Mu Tianchen, on the other hand, was worried about Yue Xin’er’s safety, on one hand, he was bored with these assassinations, he quickly gave the order to kill. After the last assassin dropped dead, he rushed back to see Yue Xin’er’s situation. He opened the door to find her leisurely drinking a cup of tea, at that moment he felt she was sometimes angry and sometimes laughable. When she is angry she would want to claw at him, but now since she is so laid back; she is laughable because she is different from other women, in such a situation she still remains calm.</p><p>“Hey, why is there a leisurely atmosphere, I’m outside with my life on the line, but yet, here you are, having a leisurely time.” Although he is not blaming her, he was worried to see that she does not worry for herself.</p><p>She poured a cup of tea and handed it to him, she closely inspected him, “Are you alright? I have heard that good people don’t live long lives, and the bad live for thousand years. In my opinion, you belong to the latter. Besides, there are so many people around you and I’m only one person.” After being with him for a few days, her temper became more and more lively. Of course, perhaps her nature was always like this, it was these few days that inspired her true nature to show.</p><p>He helplessly shook his head, now this girl is getting sharp-tongued, he estimated that in a few days he would not be able to say anything about her.</p><p>“Who are those people? How can they do this in broad daylight?” Yue Xin’er fought him with words these days, this Mu Tianchen does not seem to be so annoying, and her cool temperament had also changed a lot. Mu Tianchen looked at her in the eyes, hid his feelings in his heart, he once wanted to get close to her, to see her appearance when scared, looking at her again made him feel guilt. Nowadays, she is as curious as an ordinary girl, he would remind himself that it is only limited to himself, for others, she would only say hello.</p><p>Mu Tianchen had no choice but to tell her the truth, he told her his identity, and why the group of assassins was targeting him.</p><p>It turns out Mu Tianchen was the Grand Prince of Tianxiang Kingdom, he was the cousin without a blood relation that sent her the two pearls. He was sent to Fengyu Island to learn martial arts since childhood&nbsp;and returned to Tianxiang Kingdom five years ago. He had no ambitions for the throne, but was always regarded as a contender for the throne by the second prince Mu Tianlin, he was a thorn in the second prince’s eyes, a thorn in his flesh, one he wanted to suppress. Later, Mu Tianchen acted like a idler, spending his days ignoring the world, even so, the second prince did not let him go, from time to time, a group of assassins would be dispatched to chase after him. This time he avoided the second prince by attending the birthday ceremony of the little princess of the Jingyue Kingdom, he thought the second prince would not dare make a move on the land of another Kingdom, who knew it had already reached such a stage. It seems that Mu Tianlin could not easily let go o Mu Tianchen.</p><p>Mu Tianlin? Yue Xin’er searches for this name in her head, isn’t he aunt’s oldest son? Although Tianxiang Kingdom’s Empress was her own aunt, although she had never met that person before she had heard that father’s half-sister was spikey, now it’s even worse, she was already a poisonous woman, the son that she raised would not be any better. She never thought he would be so bold, to want to kill someone on Yue Xin’er’s territory, is it to frame Jingyue Kingdom after Mu Tianchen has been killed off? She could not help but frown at this thought, in the blink of an eye, her face returned back to its original expression, if Mu Tianlin deliberately provoked the battle, then she will eradicate him at all costs, she will never let anyone jeopardize Jingyue Kingdom, even if he is her own cousin. Now that she thinks about it, Mu Tianlin’s ambition is so great and he is a sinister person, if he becomes the emperor, he may become a tyrant and attack other countries. Although he may not attack Jingyue Kingdom first, it is difficult to guarantee that he will not attack other small countries and then use them to attack Jingyue Kingdom. With this in mind, Mu Tianlin absolutely cannot be allowed to live. At this point, Yue Xin’er already had the intentions to kill Mu Tianlin.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Xin’er, what happened? What are you thinking?”</p><p>“Ah?” Yue Xin’er has recovered and looked like nothing happened. “Nothing, I wonder if you will not run into assassination attempts during the time you return to your country?”</p><p>“Xin’er, I’m so touched, you must have fallen in love with me.” Mu Tianchen said jokingly.</p><p>Yue Xin’er stared at him, “Do you not have any face, who fell in love with you?”</p><p>Mu Tianchen puts on a smile and brings his face forward, “You began caring about me, doesn’t that prove that you fell in love with me?”</p><p>“Hump, I have not, I’m concerned about the life and death of kittens and puppies, let alone the life of a person.” Xin’er blushed but still pretended not to care.</p><p>“Hey, I say Xiner, you’re too…” Mutian looked at her helplessly. “How can you compare me to a kitten or a puppy?”</p><p>There was still some concern for him, then she remembered that since he had studied martial arts on Fengyu Island for many years, his martial arts would not be weak. After returning to Tianxiang Kingdom for five years, he could still live like this, it seems he has some tricks up his sleeves, she does not need to worry too much. Coupled with the disaster situation in Southern Wei, it is imperative that she rushes over to meet with her people. “We will be at Southern Wei soon, I want to rush to find my friend.”</p><p>After he heard that Yue Xin’er would soon leave, Mu Tianchen’s heart felt a tug: “Let me go with you!” Suddenly he felt that he was too reckless, he calmed down and slowly said: “A lone girl like you is not safe, save people to the end, send Buddha to the West, let me accompany you!”</p><ul><li>Save people to the end, send Buddha to the West: To not leave something half-way through, it’s like saving a rabbit from a trap, but not taking care of it till it gets better (Sorry, not good at examples)</li></ul><p>She knows that Mu Tianchen has always been cheeky, even if she does not let him follow her, he will try to follow anyway, instead of letting him do small tricks at the back, you might as well put him in front! “Do whatever you want, just don’t give me any unnecessary troubles and it’s fine.”</p><p>On the other hand, the gatekeepers of the Crescent Moon Palace have all arrived in Southern Wei, and they have also seen Lan Huang of the seven main gates.</p><ul><li>藍凰 Lan Huang: Blue Phoenix</li></ul><p>Lan Huang Lan Huangfeng is the head of the seven gates under Yue Xin’er, he is cautious, calm, gentle, and has the strongest ability to work. Since childhood, he has grown up with Yue Xin’er, although he is five years older than her, he has always admired her, even though he loves Yue Xin’er, he felt that he doesn’t deserve her, so he has been painfully suppressing his love for her. This time, he rushed to Southern Wei day and night, hoping to see her sooner, but he could only see other people that Yue Xin’er was not among, he could not help but get an unexplainable feeling.</p><p>“Where is master? Why isn’t master with you guys?” Lan Huang asked, pulling on the sleeve of Cheng Feng.</p><p>Their face changed and said: “Master accidentally fell into the water in the storm half a month ago&nbsp;until now there is no news.”</p><p>As soon as he heard that Yue Xin’er was struck by this disaster, Lan Huang’s calm self was completely gone, and he was roaring with red eyes: “Impossible…You must be lying to me!” In an emergency, he couldn’t help but think about other things and ran towards the pier.</p><p>At this time, Yue Xin’er just arrived at the dock in Southern Wei, just after coming down from the boat, she saw that Lan Huang had plunged into the water, she pulled him up and brought him before her, “Lan Huang, why are you doing?”</p><p>He thought he would never see the person he loved again, but when he was disheartened, his sweetheart suddenly appeared in front of himself, he was so overjoyed that Lan Huang did the boldest thing in his life, with both hands clasping Xin’er in his arms, his mouth kept shouting: “Xin’er, Xin’er, you are still alive…”</p><p>At one time, Mu Tianchen, who was standing next to Yue Xin’er, was stunned, the six gatekeepers who had followed from behind were also stunned, even Yue Xin did not respond. The first person to snap out of the daze was Mu Tianchen, his eyes were angry, he pulled Lan Huang’s arms to prevent him from embracing Yue Xin’er.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The poor Xin’er had snapped out of the daze, only to be held in another person’s arms, she was like a top, spinning round and round, she was feeling dizzy. The two men had a strong “spark” on their eyes, and when the rivals met, they became jealous and a fight occurred.</p><p>“Cough,” Yue Xin’er gave a cough, as a result, the two men still looked at each other and she coughed again, “Have you had enough? Mu Tianchen, can you let go of me?”</p><p>This is just a dream awakening people do all kinds of disguised movements, although their heart wants to see a good show, their small life is still more important. Although no one had seen Yue Xin’er’s anger, one can guess the horror of that scene.</p><p>She thought that Mu Tianchen would immediately let go of her, but who knew that he would try to hold her tighter. Lan Huang saw him like this, and suddenly his eyes rose to anger, and he sent a punch toward his face. Mu Tianchen was worried that he would hurt Yue Xin’er, on the one hand, he also wanted to try Lan Huang’s martial arts, he pushes her away from him and the exchange started.</p><p>On one side is the disciple of the world’s superiors, and the other is the head of the seven main gates from the Jianghu, their martial arts are unfathomable. After fighting for half a day, neither had yet won the victory, and the two have also expressed their sympathy for each other. In the end, Mu Tianchen had a better technique and made a trick to defeat him. Lan Huang didn’t feel dissatisfied because he lost, there were some heroes could not last his first palm.</p><p>Mu Tianchen looked forward with joy to the place where Yue Xin’er was just standing, and suddenly his face changed, Lan Huang saw him turn his head and looked at it, and suddenly a faint glow appeared on his face.</p><p>It turned out that at the time of their fight, Yue Xin’er had disappeared, three of the six Lords had also gone, they thought she was angry. Yue Xin’er never had mood swings, now she had gotten angry, everyone did not know what she would do, they looked at each other with uneasiness, it seems that the next few days would be frightening.</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>Chapter 5</strong></p><p>On the street, a woman dressed in white was walking at a steady pace, her eyes scanned her surroundings. No one could see her appearance as a veil was covering her face, but the noble and calm aura emitted from her body could not be ignored. There were several people behind the woman, every man was handsome and every woman was a breathtaking beauty, the people were stunned. It seems that the leading woman dressed in white must be stunning as well.</p><p>The woman dressed in white was Yue Xin’er, the sight along the way was no different from each other, she knew in her heart that it was impossible to get a detailed report, so she decided to leave the city to take a look.</p><p>Sure enough, outside the city was a place full of hunger and death, filled with the breath of dying patients everywhere. After all, Yue Xin’er is a princess who grew up in luxury, she squints her eyes after seeing this situation, as a faint layer of mist forms.</p><p>The seven gatekeepers saw the same tragic scene, they couldn’t help but feel sadness, regretting in their heart for not coming to treat the patients earlier, they waited for Yue Xin’er to give them their tasks, with an expectant look in their eyes.</p><p>“Godly doctors gate, heed my orders and immediately lead all the people into the community to treat the sick people. God’s Will gate, distribute plague prevention medicine. God’s Trading gate distribute food and clothing. Others helped the people affected to rebuild their homes and manage floods. If there is not enough staff in the department, Lan Huang will deploy manpower to help out.”</p><p>After listening to the orders, the crowd replied with a “subordinates heed&nbsp;the orders” and started to get to work. Yue Xin’er was not idle as the “Goddess medical doctor”, who had the best medical skills, she was busy taking the patient’s pulse. The people admired this princess, who was selfless and was not afraid of getting dirty. Mu Tian Chen was not far from her, as he could watch her busy appearance, his mouth revealing a smile that could not be seen clearly.</p><p>When God’s Trading gate gave out porridge, there was something that made Yue Xin’er extremely angry.</p><p>As of now, the county right by Yue Xin’er was called An Nan County, An Nan County’s prefecture was called He Qinan, greedy by nature, taking advantage of circumstances. Before An Nan County was flooded, he was falsely reporting the disaster to avoid being investigated, he said that he had only received minor disasters, so the emperor only allocated 1,000 dan of grain to An Nan County. It is known that the county prefecture secretly hid all the grain and sold it to local profiteers at a high price, maliciously pushing up prices, causing many people to starve to death because they could not afford food, and they also had to flee to the neighboring county town. Who would know that the county prefecture of this county is also a person who does not care about the life and death of the people, ordering guards to prevent refugees from entering the city and leaving all the refugees out of the gate, causing Yue Xin’er to see the scenes of hunger and death outside the city gates.</p><p>After hearing this news, Yue Xin’er was furious and ordered the Ying Tian men to arrest the prefectures of the two counties and all the people involved in the case. Then all the goods seized from He Qinan’s manor were taken for disaster relief, those profiteers were also arrested and given due punishment. The people heard that two large corrupt officials had been arrested and had felt a sense of great happiness.</p><ul><li>Ying Tian men: Something like the ministry of justice</li></ul><p>Disaster relief was carried out in an orderly manner, Mu Tian Chen did not hurry back to Tian Xiang Kingdom, instead, he stayed to help Yue Xin’er with the disaster, he even sent out his secretive power to help transport goods to Jingyue Kingdom. However, this move made Mu Tianlin, who was far away in the&nbsp;Tian Xiang Kingdom, feel that he was under an unprecedented threat because he now knew that his elder brother still had so many forces, which was a great threat to his own ascendant to the throne.</p><p>As the saying goes, when dark winds rise in the night, it is the ideal time to kill and set fires. Mu Tianlin spent a lot of gold to hire the number one killer of Tian Xiang Kingdom to assassinate Mu Tian Chen under the cover of night. However, he didn’t expect Mu Tianchen to be drinking with the leader of the assassins, Qing Niao who was also the number one killer in the world, the situation was not conceivable, Ye Xiao had fallen within Qing Niao’s grasps. Although no one got injured, it made Yue Xin’er more annoyed toward the cousin deepening her determination to eliminate Mu Tianlin.</p><ul><li>when dark winds rise in the night, it is the ideal time to kill and set fires: Taking advantage under favorable circumstances</li></ul><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>But Mu Tianlin still did not know that he has been brought upon himself a fatal disaster waiting to come, still secretly proud to hire the Tian Xiang Kingdom’s number one killer, believing that Mu Tian Chen is dead for sure.</p><p>It was not until two days later that he knew that Ye Xiao had failed the mission and that his corpse had not even been left intact, he decided to personally go to the Jingyue Kingdom to take care of Mu Tian Chen.</p><p>In the past few days, Yue Xin’er was busy constructing dams and helping the dying and wounded, after several days of overwork, she became ill. When Mu Tianchen found out, he made sure she was kept in bed every day, taking care of her endlessly. Within a few days, the entire man was brought into circles, the originally well-dressed, handsome man turned into a bewildered man. He even wanted to send someone to invite the world-famous goddess medical doctor, it was Zi Yuan told him that Yue Xin’er is the goddess medical doctor he was searching for, he then wanted to find the other godly doctor, but he was told that the other godly doctor is the Empress of the Jingyue Kingdom. This moment, angered him half to death, now that Yue Xin’er has gotten sick and no one can save her? Fortunately, all doctors of the Godly Doctor’s gate were elites, Yue Xin’er’s pulse was taken daily, she was given medicine, and no incidences occured.</p><p>It was not until three days later that Yue Xin’er woke up when she opened her eyes, she saw Mu Tian Chen lying on the edge of the bed, his face haggard, seemingly to have aged many years. Yue Xin’er frowned and leaned out to touch his face giving a signed, Mu Tianchen’s eyes opened as he woke up to see Yue Xin’er was already awake, so happy, he couldn’t hold back and pinched her cheeks. “Xin’er, this is great! You finally woke up.”</p><p>She was a bit shy, and was about to pull back, but found that her hand was being held firmly, she was furious, saying: “Why are you holding my hand? Let go of me.” Because she had not yet fully recovered from the illness, her body is still weak, although it is irritating, in the ears of Mu Tian Chen, it seems like a spoiled child talking, she couldn’t help but feel awkward, holding her hand tighter and not letting go of her, they came face to face “No, I won’t let go. I don’t want to let go of your hand anymore.”</p><p>“You…you do not know shame.” She blushed, because she had been deeply touched, and had never been in contact with many men, plus, those men who she saw were not respected or admired, no one has dared to be so unrestrained before her and she does not know how to deal with such a situation, she can only say that he does not know shame.</p><p>Mu Tian Chen looked at her shy face, which was even more agitated and he could not help but want to hold her in his arms before she knew it, she was already been in his arms. Yue Xin’er pushed his chest a few times, but due to her lack of strength, not only did she not succeed in pushing him away, but it also made her gasp for breath.</p><p>“How can you hold me, you rogue?” Yue Xin’er asked angrily.</p><p>“Well, if you’re ill, I won’t tease you. Do you want to eat something? I can have servants prepare for you.” Mu Tianchen had a hard time making good decisions and decided not to tease her anymore, he knew that Yue Xin’er had not fallen in love with him yet, although he was hoping to stay with her earlier, he should not rush too quickly, otherwise, it would only be counterproductive and he would have to see all of the hard work he has put in go to waste.</p><p>Yue Xin’er looked at him and said: “No need.”</p><p>“Oh, you should make up for it, you are too weak, you were unconscious for three days, you would get sick again if you don’t eat. I’ll go and ask someone to stew some chicken soup, you have to get some rest.”</p><p>“Okay.” Yue Xin’er said, pretending not to care, “You can also go for a refreshing sleep, you see that you have become disoriented. You look terrible.”</p><p>“I know, little girl, really…” Mu Tian Chen looked at her helplessly. Obviously, she was concerned about him, but she had to put on a careless indifference, she had such a strange personality.</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>Chapter 6</strong></p><p>After nearly half a month of fighting, the disaster was brought under control. Due to the precautions being&nbsp;taken by the doctor’s gate, a&nbsp;large-scale plague did not occur. Yue Xin’er’s illness was nothing big, she had also completely recovered.</p><p>On this day, Yue Xin’er quietly slipped away to the well-known lake in southern Fujian with two of her servants, she rented a boat to enjoy the beautiful scenery in the lake, when she was watching the lotus in the lake, she heard a loud noise that came from the lake. Under the influence of curiosity, the boat floated toward the source of the disturbance, she found that it was a group of masked people fighting with two men. The clothes of the two men were all tattered from the fight, yet they were still struggling. Yue Xin’er, with compassion and mercy, opened the lotus which she had just picked, as if the goddess scattered flowers, she spread the lotus seeds that covers her face to the masked people. Because she just wanted to scare them away, she did not use all of her strength and only used twenty percent of it, but she still severely injured the group of masked men. The masked men saw that the two men suddenly had more reinforcements, though they did not see the reinforcements face, and they did not dare to fend for themselves so they withdrew.</p><p>Seeing that the masked men were all gone, Yue Xin’er went ashore to bring the two men onto the boat, and the boat sails to the heart of the lake. The two men, who were already heavily injured and were tired from a long battle, fainted after seeing someone had saved them.</p><p>“Qui Xin, Qiu Xi, put these two men on the bed, and bring in two basins of water to wipe their faces, then ask the oarsmen to come in and help them change clothes!” The two maids acknowledged their orders and set off, Yue Xin’er sat down on the bedside to check on their wounds and take their pulse. Both did not suffer any serious internal injury, but it was a relatively tricky poison, added on with excessive blood loss, the injury was quite serious.</p><p>After seeing that her two maids returned with the oarsmen, Yue Xin’er nodded and went to the flower hall to think alone. What kind of person could be so vicious, the two men were poisoned with the 49 broken soul scatter, in twenty days, the poison would have activated, and they would die, but to send assassins after them, was this really necessary? The time for this poison is shortened, it is estimated that the poison will take three days to activate. There are two kinds of meanings in the 49 broken soul scatter, one is that the poison is made of forty-nine different types of poisonous grass and poisonous insects, and its toxicity is very difficult to understand. The second is that one of the poisons had no symptoms when it is in the body, the symptoms only appear when the poison had been activated. After the 49th day, the organs would have completely rotted, when they die, the host will be in extreme pain as if they had maintained an extremely peaceful smile, such as a death in sleep. This poison is very venomous, and because there is no medicine to resolve, it is generally used as a secret medicine for the court, now that it is found in the bodies of these two people, it really makes then suspicious. Although Yue Xin’er has compassion, it does not mean that she does not have a brain, the identity of these two people is probably not simple, she must first ask them clearly and then decide whether or not to help them detoxify.</p><p>“Miss, this slave has given the two men medicine, do you need to go in and check?” Qui Xin asked as she walked out.</p><p>“No need, you go fetch two carriages and send them to the courtyard, remember to take care of them.” She then took out a green porcelain bottle from her sleeves and handed it to Qui Xin, “The pills inside are to suppress the 49 broken soul scatter in them. You will help them one by one. If they wake up, you will come to me again.”</p><p>“Yes, Miss.” Qui Xin received the bottle. At this time, the boat has landed on the shore, and Yue Xin’er left by herself.</p><p>After sightseeing the entire day, she felt hungry, when she saw a restaurant, she decided to go to dinner and console herself.</p><p>Who knew that when she had just walked up the stairs, she saw an eleven or twelve-year-old boy running down the stairs, she did not get out of the way in time, and almost fell down the floor, causing the screams of the people downstairs. Just as the tragedy was about to unfold, a young man stood behind her and took her into his arms, which prevented tragedy. The veil on Yue Xin’er’s face has slipped to the ground, causing a large commotion. The man also watched and spent a long time without blinking, those infatuated eyes made Yue Xin’er blush.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>After a long period of time, Yue Xin’er lowered her head, the man still continued to stare, and had no intention of letting go, Yue Xin’er cannot help but feel embarrassed and irritated: “Haven’t you seen enough, quickly put me down.”</p><p>The man hurriedly released Yue Xin’er, and said with a red face: “Sorry, I offended Miss.” Then he picked up the veil and returned to her.</p><p>Yue Xin’er took the veil and put it back over her face, a pair of beautiful eyes glance around, and then continue to go upstairs. Although she only took a look, she found that the man is followed by two guards, it looks like this person is not simple. “Since gongzi helped this little girl, let this little girl invite gongzi to eat a meal to express thanks.”</p><ul><li>Gongzi: Way to call a young noble gentleman</li></ul><p>The man had a happy expression on his face, he followed Yue Xin’er to the second floor, all the people downstairs are buzzing that this man is really lucky, he has such a beautiful woman to dine with, that is really a blessing from his ancestors, everyone was envious.</p><p>“I am Mu Tianlin, dare to ask Miss for your surname?” As he took a seat, the man cannot wait to inquire about Yue Xin’er’s name.</p><p>“This girl’s surnamed, Yue. Mu gongzi looks like a person who is not from the Jing Yue Kingdom, is gongzi from another country?” Yue Xin’er implored. Listening to his name he should be the cousin who she has never met.</p><p>“Yes, I am from Tianxiang kingdom, I came because I heard that the Jingyue Kingdom has a beautiful scenery, so I took a tour of the mountains with two of my servants. Miss Yue, where is your family? If you are a stunning woman who is single, what can you do if you meet a bad person, how about I send you back home? ” Mu Tianlin did not say anything yet, revealing his love for Yue Xin’er.</p><p>Taking a tour of the mountains? The way I see it, you came to kill Mu Tianchen, right? There was recently a flood in the Jingyue Kingdom, no one would come to tour the mountains. “No need, I will call my servant back to pick me up. Did Mu Gongzi not know about the floods in this area? It would be bad if you were to get infected with the plague. I advised gongzi to return to Tian Xiang Kingdom as soon as possible.” Regarding this share of kinship with herself, Yue Xin’er is still unwilling to kill him completely, therefore, she wants to hint for him to return to Tian Xiang Kingdom, but this time Mu Tianlin’s whole mind is focused on her, to understand her implication, it was also when Yue Xin’er saw through his identity, he was annoyed that he did not tell truthfully and did not want her to ignore him.</p><p>“Miss Yue please do not get angry, I am not intentionally lying to you.” Then he said, “To tell the truth, I am the second prince of Tian Xiang Kingdom, as for coming at this time, it was because I heard that the Jingyue Kingdom was flooded and it was a special effort to help Jingyue Kingdom.”</p><p>“Oh? So to say, the second prince is really an enthusiastic person, this little girl really admires you.” Yue Xin’er’s tone is faint and does not reveal her disdain the slightest bit.</p><p>Mu Tianlin suddenly held up Yue Xin’er’s hand and looked at her with a smile: “Lady Yue, will you marry me!”</p><p>Yue Xin’er was terrified by his sudden confession, she did not think they were just the first time they met, he wanted to marry her, it wouldn’t be silly anymore. “Wait,” She pulled her hand out of his grip, and said in an angry manner, “Mu Gongzi, I think you made a mistake? We only met for the first time.”</p><p>“Miss Yue, you listen to me, I fell in love with you, at first sight, I am sincere to you, you must believe me.” Mu Tianlin eagerly said.</p><p>“Mu gongzi, you are a prince, and this little girl is just peasant, I don’t deserve to be with you.” This time Yue Xin’er was not polite to him, who proposed to her the first time he met her. Love? Why did he think she would like this word? Who did she like? As soon as she thought of this, Mu Tianchen came to her mind, she could not help but be ashamed and angry. Could it be she had started to like Mu Tianchen, that playboy?</p><p>Mu Tianlin didn’t notice Yue Xin’er’s thoughts, but when she was shy and thought she still didn’t believe in herself, she said: “Miss Yue, don’t you believe me? I don’t care about your identity. As long as you marry me, I will wholeheartedly treat you. I can swear that I will only marry you in this life, later if I become the Emperor, you would the Empress.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Enough, Mu Gongzi, we just meet each other, I thought you were a gentleman. I didn’t think you were a lecher. We will meet each other again.” After that, she did not wait for Mu Tianlin to respond, she stood up and walked downstairs.</p><p>“Miss Yue, Miss Yue …” Mu Tianlin’s cries came from behind. When she first came downstairs, she saw Qiu Xi and others waiting outside the restaurant, holding the reins of two horses in her hands. The two ignored those behind them and jumped to the horse and rushed toward the other yard. Even the two guards that Mu Tianlin originally chased out did not respond and they had lost sight of their shadows.</p><p>“Qiu Xi, did the two people wake up?”</p><p>“Replying to Miss, they have woken up. I heard that Miss was here, so this servant brought the horses over.”</p><p>“Perfect timing. Take me to see them.” While talking, they soon got to the courtyard, and Qiu Xin had already been waiting at the gate.</p><p>Yue Xin’er followed Qiu Xin through the courtyard, Qiu Xin took her to the room where the two men reside. When she rescued them, she didn’t pay attention to their looks, now that she had looked closely she found out that the man wearing a black robe had extraordinary features, the clothes are warm and jade-like, and it seems to be the master of the man in blue. The two men saw Yue Xin’er coming in, and their eyes could not help stir, even if she wore a veil, it still couldn’t hide her natural beauty.</p><p>“Is it Miss who saved us?” The man in black robes asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Yue Xin’er did not stop and directly brought up the subject. “Dare I ask the two gongzi’s surname?”</p><p>“My name is Ling Feiyu, this is my servant Fei Mo, thank you, Miss, for your life-saving grace.” Ling Feiyu clenched his fists to express his gratitude.</p><p>Yue Xin’er didn’t panic, from the stool, she took a cup of tea and took a sip. “Your life is not exactly saved, your body has been poisoned with 49 broken soul scatter, even if I saved you now, after three days, you will still die.”</p><p>When Fei Mo heard, he opened his eyes and struggled to kneel before Yue Xin’er. “Miss, I beg you to save my family’s young master.”</p><p>“Oh? How does Fei Mo gongzi know that I can save your family’s young master?” Yue Xin’er still calmly drinks tea and does not take a look at Fei Mo.</p><p>“Since Miss knows of the 49 broken soul scatter than you must know how to cure it. If Miss can save my family’s young master than this villain is willing to go through the fire for Miss.” She could not help but admire Fei Mo’s firm expression, to have such a servant, what else can one ask for!</p><ul><li>Villain: Usually how someone lower in rank would address themselves towards someone above them in rank or status.</li></ul><p>“Fei Mo, get up, if Miss is willing to save us then she will naturally save, if it is not willing, then we can only say it was meant to be this way.” Ling Feiyu also got out of bed and pulled Fei Mo up.</p><p>“You don’t have to be like this, as long as you let me know the cause for you getting poisoned and being chased, I will save you.”</p><p>Ling Feiyu listened to her and knowing that she did not trust their identity and told her the things one by one.</p><p>It turned out that Ling Feiyu was the son of the prime minister of the Jingyue Kingdom. Since Mu Tianlin’s ambition has grown, some of the Emperors have become the pieces on a chess board, and they have begun to focus on the Jingyue Kingdom. Trying their best to engulf the Jingyue Kingdom in chaos, beginning to draw the ministers of Jingyue Kingdom to their side. Some time ago, Mu Tianlin sent a secret letter to the Prime Minister’s manor, saying that it was Ling Xiaotian to cooperate with him. As a result, Ling Xiaotian was loyal to Jingyue, even the heavens and the earth could be witnesses, and he refused. In the beginning, Mu Tianlin also thought about trying both soft and hard methods. First, he had given Ling Feiyu, the 49 broken soul scattered poison, wanting to use this to force Ling Xiaotian. As a result, Ling Xiaotian was still unmoved, therefore, Mu Tianlin couldn’t draw Ling Xiaotian to his side, and he began to remove this person, he told the Emperor Yue Feng of the Jingyue Kingdom to report of a rebellion. As a result, Yue Feng imprisoned Ling Xiaotian, but there was no punishment. Mu Tianlin did not succeed in seeing the traitor disposed of, so he sent an assassin to chase and kill Ling Feiyu, which was not implicated, this was the scene where Yue Xin’er saved him, following.</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>Chapter 7</strong></p><p>In fact, this month, Yue Xin’er had received a secret letter from her Emperor brother, she also knew some of the beginning and the end, but also knew that Yue Feng is not a tyrant emperor, knowing to discuss with her before dealing with such things She felt that something was wrong at the time, so she told Yue Feng that he should first put Ling Xiaotian into prison. Although Ling Xiaotian was imprisoned on the surface it actuality he was strictly protected. She didn’t expect this incident to be related to Mu Tianlin, she didn’t protect Ling Feiyu’s and his people in time, if she had paid more attention to the political affairs at the time, this might not have happened today.</p><p>“Ling gongzi, don’t worry, my lady will definitely be able to solve your poison.” Qiu Xi said indifferently.</p><p>“Ah, it’s just that 49 broken soul scatter is a secret poison used by the imperial court, there is a rumor that no one can cure it. If your Miss can cure it then it is the best, if not, we, Master and servant, will not blame you.” Ling Feiyu said.</p><p>Yue Xin’er’s lips curved into a smile: “Ling gongzi is the son of a loyal minister, I naturally will not let go. I am able to cure your poison.”</p><p>“You can rest assured, my lady is the famous goddess medical doctor. Others may not be able to save you, but my lady will definitely be able to save you.” Qiu Xi’s eyes looked at Yue Xin’er with admiration&nbsp;and proudly said.</p><p>Yue Xin’er sees that Ling Feiyu’s Master and servant pair are surprised, she thought about it and decide to tell them her identity clearly, so that they can rest assured on Ling Xiaotian’s matter. “I am the Princess Gu Gou of the Jingyue Kingdom. I already know about your father’s predicament, you don’t have to worry. I will let people investigate as soon as possible, to proclaim official Ling’s innocence.”</p><p>When the Master and the servant heard that they were in front of Princess Gu Gou, they quickly kneeled down, “Thank you, princess.”</p><p>She frowned and raised her sleeves, her internal force was used to hold them up. “There is no need to do such a ceremony, also we have not protected you properly, otherwise you will not be poisoned. You should rest well, leave the matter to me, so have peace of mind and heal, Mu Tianlin’s tentacles will not be able to reach here, I will go back first, and come back tomorrow to help you detoxify the poison.”</p><p>Finished speaking, she instructed the two maids to take good care of them before riding back to the county hall on a horse.</p><p>When she had return back to the country, she went straight to the hall, now the county magistrates in Mo Nan County and An Nan County have been executed, the back hall is naturally empty. For Yue Xin’er’s convenience, together with the seven gate guards and Mu Tianchen and other people have been staying there.</p><p>“Master, you have returned!” Zi Yuan saw Yue Xin’er and hurriedly greeted her “Why did you go out alone? Everyone was worried.”</p><p>“Fine, don’t worry, am I not alright? You go summon the seven gatekeepers, I have important things to tell them.”</p><p>Zi Yuan saw the seriousness on Yue Xin’er’s face&nbsp;and quickly went to call them, after a while, the seven gatekeepers were called, and Mu Tianchen was also following behind. Yue Xin’er did not say anything, taking him as a transparent person, anyway since this was also done by Tian Xiang, it is best to let him know.</p><p>Seeing that everyone is seated, Yue Xin began to speak: “Earlier, I told you to investigate official Ling, how is the investigation?”</p><p>Several people looked at each other, and finally, Lan Huang said something, “Replying to Master, this matter has not been investigated yet, but there is a clear picture.”</p><p>Yue Xin’er is beautiful face became cold, “It seems that your ability has weakened recently? Such an important thing can’t be done well. Do you want to train again?”</p><p>The seven gatekeepers’ faces changed when they heard it, they know that not everyone can endure the training that Yue Xin’er gives, the seven of them were chosen out of 100 participants, and through multiple hardships, they became gatekeepers. Now Yue Xin’er said that they should train again, and they also know that training will be crueler than before.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Master, these subordinates are incompetent, asking Master for punishment.” The seven gatekeepers quickly kneeled, Yue Xin’er appeared to be indifferent to everything on the surface, but treating her subordinates, sometimes one had to be tough and sometimes tolerant. This time they did not carry out her order well, and it is natural for Yue Xin’er to be unhappy.</p><p>“Get up,” Yue Xin’er said, she saw they were scared, and they didn’t want her to blame them, they were really busy recently “This matter has already ended.” So she told them everything from the beginning to end.</p><p>As Yue Xin’er was speaking, she noticed the expression of Mu Tianchen&nbsp;and found that he just frowned and seemed to cover it up very well. “Tianchen, do you have anything to say?”</p><p>“I…”, Mu Tianchen said with some embarrassment, “I am unclear, but if Tianlin really did these things, then I would not cover for him, Xin’er, what do you want to do? We’ll go with what you wish.”</p><p>“Very good, I wanted you to say this.” Yue Xin’er nodded with satisfaction, and there was a touch of twilight in her eyes. “So, then, send someone to watch Mu Tianlin, if he makes another move, kill without remorse.”</p><p>“But, Master, Mu Tianlin is a prince of Tian Xiang Kingdom, if he dies on the soil of Jing Yue Kingdom, then the Tian Xiang Kingdom…” Cheng Feng said with worry.</p><p>“Is the prince of Tian Xiang Kingdom ever coming to the Jing Yue Kingdom? Why did we never receive such news?” Yue Xin’er asked faintly.</p><p>“What you’re saying is, he came quietly, the Jing Yue Kingdom never received such news, even if he were to meet his death, the Jing Yue Kingdom would not know.” Mu Tianchen said.</p><p>“Meaning, if he goes back to the Tian Xiang Kingdom earlier, I will not make it hard for him, it is just that I understand him. He will not let this good opportunity pass, and will make waves in the peaceful Jing Yue Kingdom.” Yue Xin’er knew that Mu Tianchen is not willing to bear it after all Mu Tianlin is still his younger brother.</p><ul><li>Make waves: Cause a disturbance</li></ul><p>Mu Tianchen sees that Yue Xin’er’s mind has been set, and no longer advises her, even if Mu Tianlin is dead, it is considered an end to a lot of injustice, it depends on his own doing.</p><p>Next, Yue Xin’er gave some orders and sent some people to protect Ling Tianyu’s Master and servant pair.</p><p>The moonlight is hazy, and Yue Xin’er is sitting on the stone bench, smelling the faint scent of flowers carried in the wind, playing a song called 《The Fairy》. Mu Tianchen went into the courtyard after hearing the sound, he saw Yue Xin’er, like a fairy in the moon, stroking the Qin under the moonlight. There was no makeup, only natural beauty, people cannot help but be moved after seeing it.</p><p>The song ended, but there was still a lingering tune that would stay there for three days, such a heavenly melody was rare in the mortal world.</p><p>“Pa pa” Mu Tianchen clapped as he walked towards Yue Xin’er, ” Xin’er, you play it so beautifully, it is hard to find such a tune in the mundane world!”</p><p>“Why did you come?” Yue Xin’er gave him a glance as her delicate hand twirled the strings.</p><p>“I couldn’t fall asleep, Xin’er, do you want to sleep with me?” Mu Tianchen looked at her slyly.</p><p>She didn’t even lift her head and walked straight into the room with her guzheng in hand, “You take care of yourself, and be careful of assassins at night.”</p><p>Mu Tianchen followed behind her and went into her room “Don’t be like this, let’s talk.”</p><p>“Please, but if you want to plead for your brother, then you can go back to your room.”</p><p>“Rest assured, I will not plead for him. Since he does not care about brotherhood, I am not the Goddess of Mercy that saves the suffering, if you want to do it, do it. However, if he dies in the Jingyue Kingdom, you and I will not be able to excuse anyway, my father will be influenced by your aunt’s instigation and command troops to invade the Jingyue Kingdom.”</p><p>“Auntie married from the Jingyue Kingdom to the Tian Xiang Kingdom, will she really wage war on the Jingyue Kingdom?” Yue Xin’er asked with some doubts.</p><p>Mu Tianchen looked at her helplessly, how can this girl sometimes be intelligent and scary, yet sometimes innocent and smiling. “You think about it, your aunt only has one son, Tianlin, you kill her son, it would be strange if she does not go mad. Besides, do you think your aunt is such a good person? If she did not support him, how would Tianlin dare to let people send assassins after me? Would he dare to do it in the Jingyue Kingdom?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“You mean, my aunt has already had a vicious heart?” she asked suspiciously.</p><p>“Yes, your aunt married into the Tian Xiang Kingdom and took charge of the harem, but because her ambition was too big, my father did not like her very much, so she tried to persecute the consorts of the harem. My mother consort was killed by her. I originally had several imperial brothers, but they have either been killed or expelled from the palace.”</p><p>There was a trace of anger in the eyes of Yue Xin’er, she didn’t expect her aunt to be such a person, before, it was only said that she was just overbearing, the princess had a big temper, she never thought that she was so vicious, it seems she must get rid of that mother and son pair.</p><p>“Your mother consort, how did she…”</p><p>“Do not mention this matter, you should not know the dirty tactics in the harem. I really envy you, although you are born in the court&nbsp;but, your destiny is much better than mine, at least there is no scheming between your brothers and sisters.” Yue Xin’er looked at him silently, now he is so fragile, and there is sadness within his eyes.</p><p>“Do you hate my aunt?”</p><p>Mu Tianchen smiled and said: “Hate. How could I not hate? It’s just that before my mother consort died, she told me not to hate others, it will be very painful to live like this. But how can I ever forget my mother consort’s death?”</p><p>Yue Xin looked at him distressedly and held him in her arms. “Chen gege, don’t be in despair, everything is in the past, in the future, I will accompany you.”</p><p>He looked at her silently, noticed the firmness in her eyes, he slowly reached out and wrapped around her waist, “Xin’er, what about you? I also want to know something about you, you are always so mysterious.”</p><p>“Me? I was brought to the mountain from an early age and lived with Master,&nbsp; just because I am a goddess. Do you know what a goddess is?” Yue Xin’er put on a bitter smile, “I am just a little girl, and I was given the responsibility of safeguarding the world when I was born. Over the years, Master has kept watch over me, I can’t reveal emotions, can’t let others see my face, can’t go down the mountain to see my brother, sister, otherwise, a calamity will occur. Therefore, I always suppress my emotions, even after facing my emperor father and empress mother, I can’t show a happy expression. When my sister, Yue Ling was spoiled in my parents’ arms, I practiced the martial arts that Master taught me over and over again, when Yue Ling was playing with others, I could only stay in the pharmacy to identify the medicine and memorize the medical books. From a very young age, I began to adopt children who were orphans, and in order to take up the responsibility of my guardianship, I trained them to prepare for the unexpected. So that’s why Crescent Moon Palace exists.”</p><p>“Xin’er, it has been hard on you.” Mu Tianchen has a feeling of mutual sympathy for Yue Xin’er he left the palace and followed his Master, he passed his days the same as her, but he was more fortunate than her, at least his brothers accompanied him and he enjoyed his childhood.</p><p>She smiled faintly, walked to the window, and looked out, her eyes looked very ethereal, and the moonlight sprinkled on her body, with a mysterious and lonely feeling. The night wind blows, her clothes are fluttering, and there is a feeling of being carried by the wind&nbsp;as if she did not belong to the mortal world. Mu Tianchen was fascinated by her appearance, for the first time, he saw such an ethereal and beautiful Yue Xin’er. He used to listen to rumors that Goddess Medical Doctor is an indifferent and unaffected person, he has been with her for a few months, knowing that she is not as what the rumor had said. In the beginning, he just wanted to tease her and wanted her to show her true nature, gradually, he was attracted by her kindness, beauty, and knowledge. It’s just that what this little girl knows is not true love, he still doesn’t know how many twists and turns in his own life there will be, plus with the tigers and wolves around, watching her seven gatekeepers, aside from that Zi Yuan who is a woman, he knew that he like Xin’er. He just doesn’t know if this little girl really doesn’t understand or pretends not to understand love, it seems that his road to love is a long path.</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>Chapter 8</strong></p><p>Early the next morning, after an hour of organizing medicine, Yue Xin’er finally produced the antidote for 49 broken soul scatter. Although it was not difficult to produce the antidote, it is unclear of the combination of poisons that made it, therefore it takes a long time to analyze it in detail.</p><p>When preparing to go the courtyard to detoxify Ling Feiyu’s and his servant’s poison, she met Mu Tianchen at the gate. Mu Tianchen insisted on going, even if Yue Xin’er did not want him to tag along she had to agree. Along the way, Mu Tianchen was a chatterbox and kept talking, he was teasing her but Yue Xin’er ignored it, treating his words as a buzzing fly.</p><p>When they were about to pass a tea house, someone suddenly stepped in front of them, preventing them from going forwards, Yue Xin’er looked up to see Mu Tianlin with a guard in front of him, her eyebrows slightly wrinkles.</p><p>“Miss Yue, we finally meet again.” Mu Tianlin gracefully, he looked like an easy going gongzi with a&nbsp;fan.</p><p>She squinted at Mu Tianchen, couldn’t Mu Tianlin recognize Mu Tianchen? Then there was a cold reply: “Isn’t Mu Gongzi going to returned to Tianxiang?”</p><p>However, seeing Mu Tianlin close Yue Xin’er, in a carefree manner he said: “If Miss does not agree to my proposal, I will not go back.”</p><p>At this time, Mu Tianchen pushed Mu Tianlin away, and sarcastically said: “When did second brother start to tease women?”</p><p>Mu Tianlin only glanced at the man who had been at the side of Yue Xin’er and ignored him, Mu Tianchen was the man he hated the most. In a bad tone, he asked: “Eldest imperial brother, how are you here? You are not…”</p><p>The surrounding guards heard Mu Tianlin calling the big brother, knowing that the man in front of them was the Grand imperial prince, they quickly said: “Greeting the Grand imperial prince.” Mu Tianchen waved his hand.</p><p>“Am I not what?” Mu Tianchen raised an eyebrow and deliberately said those words.</p><p>Seeing him like this, Mu Tianlin suddenly understood that he had entered his trap, one must know that if you plot murder against your elder brother, and you are known by Tian Xiang’s people or your own imperial father, it will have a great influence on you owning throne. He hurriedly said: “Imperial brother, are you not in the Jingyue Kingdom for princess Gu Gou’s birthday celebration? Why are you here?”</p><p>Mu Tianchen then asked: “Shouldn’t second brother be in the Tian Xiang Kingdom? Why are you in Jingyue kingdom?”</p><p>“I came here to tour, but who knew I would bump into imperial brother, it’s a coincidence, isn’t it?” Mu Tianlin looked towards his guards and they nodded, then they looked towards Yue Xin’er who had not been included in the conversation. “Does imperial brother know this lady?”</p><p>Mu Tianchen sneered in his heart, it seems that this second brother who has always regarded a woman as nothing has really fallen for Xin’er, he can see his brother’s sentiment, but this time he will not make any concessions. Seeing that he has been staring at Yue Xin’er, he grabbed her waist and looked like an intimate couple: “Yeah, Miss Yue is the biggest harvest of my trip to Jingyue Kingdom, in the future,&nbsp;you can address her as sister in law!” Sure enough, seeing Mu Tianlin face change, the flaw in his eyes is obvious.</p><p>This time, Yue Xin’er did not push him away and allow her to hold onto her waist, under the cover of her sleeves, she pinches his waist, Mu Tianchen wrinkles his eyebrows from the pain. Because the two are close together and they are secretly moving. Coupled with the fact that Mu Tianlin is screaming inwardly at what Mu Tianchen said just now, he did not noticed the small movement of the two people.</p><p>“In this case, when will imperial brother return to the Tian Xiang Kingdom?”</p><p>However, Mu Tianchen was unpredictable and said: “When I go back, I will go back. Second brother, I am afraid that it is not right for you to go to the Jingyue Kingdom.</p><p>“No need for elder imperial brother to worry, I know what to do.” The proud Mu Tianlin ate a soft nail, but still refused to accept the verb, he reluctantly looked at Yue Xin’er, and walked away with his guards.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“The play is over, let’s go.” Yue Xin’er took the lead and walked in front, Mu Tianchen touched his nose and followed behind her.</p><p>After walking for half an incense stick, they arrived at the courtyard, Yue Xin’er arrived at the quarters of Ling Feiyu and his servant, she turned back around to Mu Tianchen: “You can explore the yard, I will go to detoxify them.”</p><p>He nodded and walked up in the yard, thinking about Mu Tianlin, although he announced the ownership of Yue Xin’er to Mu Tianlin today, but based on the understanding of his younger brother, he knows that Mu Tianlin will not give up. Not to mention the beauty of Yue Xin’er, as long as a man sees her their heart will be moved, she is the woman he likes and Mu Tianlin will try his best to get her and fight him. Today’s action, he does not know whether it was the right or wrong thing to do, it may not be troublesome for Yue Xin’er, he is somewhat annoyed.</p><p>After an hour, Yue Xin’er finally came out of the room, with a layer of dense sweat on her forehead, with a pale face, it seemed that the poison was cured, the energy spent was not small. Mu Tianchen, who was standing in the yard saw her coming out and hurriedly greeted her but when he saw her tired look and quickly came to assist her.</p><p>“Xin’er, are you okay?” Mu Tianchen asked worriedly.</p><p>Yue Xin’er shook her head, but did not try to escape from his grip, she weakly said: “Help me to the eastern wing, I need to rest.”</p><p>Mu Tianchen was busy helping her into the main house, Qiu Xin also followed, and after Mu Tianchen was driven out, Yue Xin’er was lying on the bed, she told Qiu Xin that she would not be seeing anyone within these three days, and let her send someone to take care of Ling Feiyu’s master and servant pair along with Mu Tianchen, while she went to sleep.</p><p>After sleeping for three days, Yue Xin’er finally woke up, at that time, she used up almost all of her internal energy to solve the poison, she did not expect that after she left yesterday, she did not send someone to protect them, and they were poisoned with the Worry Free poison. The Worry Free poison is a kind of medicine that can make people feel illusions. It does not cause harm to the human body, but just like opium it can temporarily stop the pain, but when it is mixed with the 49 broken soul scatter it becomes even more poisonous as the person will most likely go on the yellow springs road. Fortunately, when Qiu Xi and Yue Xin’er gave them the detoxification medicine, she temporarily suppressed the poison of the yellow springs.</p><p>When she woke up, she found that the environment around her did not seem to be familiar, she couldn’t help but be shocked, looking around, it seems that she is no longer in the Jingyue Kingdom. Beside her bed, there was a maidservant who saw Yue Xin’er wake up, and hands her a cup of water. Yue Xin’er took two sips from the cup and asked a casual question: “Where is this place? How did I come here?”</p><p>“Replying to Miss, this is Yu Lin Palace of the Tian Xiang Kingdom, it was our second prince who brought you here.” The two palace ladies saw that the Yue Xin’er did not make a big commotion after waking up, and they felt admiration towards her. Due to the fact that this is the first woman brought back by the second prince, it seems that this woman would become their future empress, thus their words were very respectful.</p><ul><li>雨霖宮: Yu Lin Palace; Yu means rain, and Lin means continuous, it is also the same lin as in Mu Tianlin’s name.</li></ul><p>It turned out that Mu Tianlin brought her to the Tian Xiang Kingdom when she was asleep and did not have the ability to protect herself, it seems that his courage is getting bigger and bigger. After thinking about it, the people in the Crescent Moon Palace actually allowed her to be taken away under their watchful eyes, it is neglecting of duty, it seems that when she returns, she should help them reorganize well.</p><p>After telling the two palace ladies to help her dress up, when she changed into the clothing of the Tian Xiang Kingdom she still looked beautiful, with her unique style, the two palace ladies who watched could not help but be stunned. It is no wonder that the second prince would like the girl so much, they were women and even them could not help but like her. It stands to reason that a beautiful woman will be the jealousy of others, but her sacred temperament and calmness are fascinating, the more they look the more awkward she feels.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Miss, are you hungry?” Cui Ping, one of the palace ladies asked.</p><p>She nodded, she didn’t eat for three days, it was due to her deep internal strength that she didn’t feel hungry. But eating is necessary, and you are not stupid enough to go fight with one’s own stomach, adapt to the situation and you will be safe. When you are full, you will be able to fight with Mu Tianlin.</p><p>When she was about to move, Mu Tianlin came in from the door and sat next to Yue Xin’er as soon as she entered the hall. Yue Xin’er didn’t pay attention to him as he was eating and drinking gracefully. Mu Tianlin saw that he was ignored, he estimated that bringing her without her consent had made her unhappy. He ordered another palace lady, Cui Huan, to add a set of tableware and bury his head in silence, looking up at Yue Xin’er from time to time. As a result, he saw that she still ate food without looking at him, and he could not help but put the bowl on the table with frustration. Yue Xin’er squinted at him and didn’t eat it, she put the bowl down and snorted: “What? Is the second prince angry at this little girl?”</p><p>“Miss Yue, I admit that it is wrong for me to take you to the Tian Xiang Kingdom, but that is because I love you! Since you have already come, please stay with me and be my consort!”</p><ul><li>Consort: 王妃: Wang Fei; Legal wife of a prince who is not the emperor</li></ul><p>“What a joke, I have already told you, I do not convey it.” Yue Xin’er said with indignation, her heart was extremely disgusted with Mu Tianlin.</p><p>“Do not convey? Then why did you promise to marry Mu Tianchen? How is he better than me? Growing up, imperial father favored him&nbsp;and gave him anything he desired. Later, he went away to study martial arts, I finally didn’t need to see him. Why did he still have to come back? Why is he even robbing me of the woman I love? Why?” Mu Tianlin saidin a more crazed manner, grabbing Yue Xin’er’s, nearly shaking her to death.</p><p>After being shaken, she pushed him away. This man, it seems that his martial arts is not low, she must not let him know about her martial arts, otherwise she does not know whether he will drug her. “Enough, I didn’t even see that you loved me. We only knew a few days. You go, I don’t want to see you.” Finished speaking, she no longer cares for him and walks back to the bed to lie down. Mu Tianlin saw that she was too angry, he knew that she was still angry with him, realizing that he was a little too eager, he did not want to force her at this time. After all, there were plenty of time in the future, he thought that he would be extra nice to her in the future, he then ordered the two palace ladies to take good care of Yue Xin’er, before leaving.</p><p>After hearing Mu Tianlin’s departure, Yue Xin’er decided to stay in the Tian Xiang Kingdom for the time being, this Mu Tianlin, she definitely could not let him become the emperor, and Mu Tianchen did not seem to want to be the emperor, then during this time in the Tian Xiang Kingdom, she will see if anyone can do it. Although it seems that she should not worry too much about the internal affairs of other countries, but whether it is for the Jingyue Kingdom to be free from the aggression of other countries or her identity as a “goddess”, she definitely cannot allow a dangerous person appear. Thinking about it, she fell asleep.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Jingyue Kingdom, when Qiu Xin discovered that Yue Xin’er had disappeared, she immediately informed Mu Tianchen. Mu Tianchen quickly rushed to the county to inform the people of the Crescent Moon Palace, and for a moment the clouds were bleak. Lan Huang immediately gave Mu Tianchen a punch, because Mu Tianchen was absent-minded he did not escape, so they had a match.</p><p>“MuTianchen, you are a jerk, why didn’t you follow the palace to protect her safety? How could you allow her to be taken away?” After Lan Huang hit Mu Tianchen, he was dragged by other people, causing the fire in his heart to be even greater.</p><p>Mu Tianchen wiped the blood from his mouth&nbsp;and looked at Lan Huang obliquely: “I allowed Yue Xin’er to be taken away under my eyes. But what about you? Didn’t you send someone to guard the other house before? Why did your people allow them to take Yue Xin’er away?”</p><p>“Mu Gongzi, you are right, this is a difficult thing for us, we deserve to be blamed. In my opinion, we should send people to find the princess!” Chi Wu quickly came to calm the field, “Lan Huang, the way I see, you should return to the capital first, to tell the emperor about the disappearance of the palace lord. The rest of the people, mobilize all the people who can be mobilized to find the palace lord. Don’t be too anxious, I believe that the palace lord will be fine, let’s say that her ability is clear to all of us, we don’t want it to be chaotic.”</p><p>When everyone listened to Chi Wu, they calmed down and arranged their hands together to find the traces of Yue Xin’er. Mu Tianlin did not know how much trouble was caused by his own selfishness, which would become his reminder.</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>Chapter 9</strong></p><p>It has been a few days since Yue Xin’er came to the Tian Xiang Kingdom, in these few days, Mu Tianlin came to the Tian Yue Pavillion a few times, every time he came, he would bring her something new. Sometimes it was exotic grasses, sometimes it was jewelry, sometimes it was antique calligraphy and painting by famous figures, sometimes it was small animals, as long as he could find it, he would give it to her, just to get a smile from the beauty. As a result, Yue Xin’er doesn’t even look at it, let alone smile, this caused Mu Tianlin to get a taste of unprecedented frustration.</p><p>Mu Tianlin had grown up getting what he wanted. A woman, he could have any of them, and it has always been those women who throw themselves to him. Although he is very clear that most of the women are looking at him for his prince’s identity, so he never looked at them. Although he has many concubines, none of them are of a good quality. Now, he has met a woman who has moved his heart, but she is different from other women, he really does not know how to move her.</p><p>On this day, Yue Xin’er took a walk with the two palace ladies in the garden, and Mu Tianlin went to morning court. As she walked to a pond, she heard someone calling for help. She calmed her nerves and took a look, it was a woman. There are several eunuchs and palace ladies on the shore who are anxiously shouting, but no one is going to save the person. Yue Xin’er did not think much, and infused her internal force into her ribbon, shouting: “Hold onto the ribbon.”</p><p>The woman has been in the water for a long time, her whole spirit has been paralyzed, it was as if she has not heard Yue Xin’er shouting. Seeing that the woman was almost out of the water, Yue Xin’er quickly jumped into the water and picked her up, then dragged her to the shore. Yue Xin’er laid the woman on the grass, she pressed her hand on the woman’s abdomen to get the water out of her body after she did this, she was at peace.</p><p>She saw the group of eunuchs and palace ladies gather around, calling: “Princess, Princess…” Taking a look at the woman’s dress, it is really the costume of the Tian Xiang Kingdom, it seems that this woman should be Mu Tianchen’s younger sister.</p><p>“You all scattered, otherwise your princess will be out of breath.” Yue Xin’er said coldly, seeing that they all retreated, and took out a yellow porcelain bottle and poured out a green pill into the woman’s mouth. After a while, the fainted woman woke up. “How does your body feel?” Yue Xin’er asked.</p><p>The woman stared at Yue Xin’er for a while, before she weakly said, “It’s okay. Did you save me?”</p><p>“Yes.” Yue Xin’er nodded, “What is your name?”</p><p>The surrounding eunuchs and palace ladies heard her asking the princess’s name, they could not help but widen her eyes. several people have already began slandering Yue Xin’er. Yue Xin’er glanced at them with an expressionless face, her cold eyes suddenly made them feel chills.</p><p>“Thank you, my name is Mu Tianxing. What about you?” Mu Tianxing was originally cheerful and lively, when she saw someone who was so beautiful and not afraid of her, she was curious about this savior.</p><p>Seeing her innocence, Yue Xin’er also liked this girl a bit, according to her knowledge, Mu Tianxing should be his fourth younger sister of Mu Tianchen, she should have a twin brother named Mu Tianri. The Tian Xiang Kingdom only has three princes and one princess. It’s not that those consorts can’t give birth, nor is it that the emperor has a hidden disease. The thing is that the empress is too fierce, every time the emperor goes to his consorts, after the night, the empress will personally bring the abortion soup the next day. Even if some of them have tried their best to have a dragon seed, the empress will try to make her have a miscarriage, in order to make her son the crown prince, the empress can be said to be a schemer, anyway, as long as you can think of the malicious schemes, it is almost certain the empress has used it. Mu Tianchen went outside to learn martial arts, and Mu Tianri stayed in the palace for a long time, she really does not know how the days are for him, Mu Tianxing is a girl, so she is no threat to the throne, naturally, her days are better. But thinking about it this way, the fact that Mu Tianri can survive in such an environment, if there is not a bit of skill he would not be able to live until today, it seems that this palace is really a place of Crouching Tigers, Hidden Dragons.</p><ul><li>Dragon seed: children of the emperor</li></ul><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Although she had good feelings for her, she did not intend to tell her her real name, so she told her: “I am Yue Tianxin, you can call me Xin’er.”</p><p>Mu Tianxing showed a sweet smile, sat up and took her hand, saying: “Xin’er, I like you very much. Let’s be friends!”</p><p>“Go back and change your clothes, or you will catch cold.” Friends? I have no friends in my life. She regard those subordinates as friends, but they always keep their duty, she knows that they are respectful and loving when they look at her. Although they grew up together, she has always been seen as unattainable in their eyes. Therefore, she never criticizes them, lest everyone be embarrassed. Now, she finally has a friend.</p><p>“Okay, where are do you reside? I will go to find you after changing clothes.”</p><p>Cui Ping, who was following Yue Xin’er said: “Replying to princess, our lady is currently residing in Tian Yue Pavillion of the second prince.”</p><p>“What? Xin’er, you live in the Tian Yue Pavilion of the second prince? Are you his…” Mu Tianxing was shocked. The there was no one living Tian Yue Pavillion of the second prince, she had heard that it would be reserved for the future consort, now that she heard that Xin’er was living there, how could she not be surprised?</p><p>Yue Xin’er said seriously: “There is no such thing, you should go back. Come over and find me later.”</p><p>The palace ladies and eunuch, who has been surrounded them has come forward to help Mu Tianxing return to her palace, Yue Xin’er is disgusted to see her wet clothes, and said to the two palace ladies who was with her: “Let’s go back.”</p><p>Back at Tian Yue Pavilion, she took a hot shower, changed her clothes, she sat down at a table and drank a cup of hot tea, the feeling was warm and comfortable. If not for the fact that Mu Tianxing was coming over, she would have gone to bed.</p><p>Just when she was feeling drowsy, a palace lady named Cui Wei reported that Princess Tianxing had arrived. This was the thing that woke her up, and it didn’t take long for her to see Mu Tianxing’s delicate figure leaping in, and there was a man following behind her who’s features was similar to her. Yue Xin’er was stunned after giving man a glance, this is the third prince of Tian Xiang Kingdom, Mu Tianri!</p><p>“You two, please sit.” After that, Cui Wei pick up some fruit snacks, one person took a cup of tea and handed it over,after that, the people retired, then she looked at Mu Tianri and said: “You must be the third prince of Tian Xiang Kingdom.”</p><p>“Miss really has good eyesight, I admire it.” Mu Tianri said cupping his fist.</p><p>“How is it, brother, I said that Xin’er is very powerful, you still don’t believe, this is what you see with your own eyes to see what else you have to say.” Mu Tianxing said slyly.</p><p>Seeing that their brothers and sisters are so good, Yue Xin’er is somewhat envious, although she has a brother and a sister, her relationship with them is not close, this may be because she grew up in the mountains.</p><p>“Miss Yue, thank you for saving Xing’er. We can never repay you, in the future, if there is anything you need help with, just say it.” Mu Tianri said.</p><p>“It was just a matter of raising my hand, you don’t have to remember it. Third prince, I want to ask you one thing, I hope you can tell the truth.” After the chill, Yue Xin’er went straight to the subject, she nodded, he continued to say, “Do you want to the emperor of the Tian Xiang Kingdom?”</p><p>When the question was asked, the two brothers and sister were stunned. “Miss Yue, what do you mean by this? Do you know if you let others hear it, you will get executed.”</p><p>“Yeah, Xin’er, things can be eaten indiscriminately, but you can’t talk nonsense.” Mu Tianxing said.</p><p>Yue Xin’er’s eyes stared at Mu Tianri’s eyes without hesitation and said seriously: “Third prince, I am not joking with you, I hope that you can answer my question as it is, there are no others around, you don’t have to worry.”</p><p>“I… think, but what about it? Second brother has the empress behind him, and I am only the third prince, even if the second prince is not here, there is the eldest prince.” Seeing his eyes bright and honest, not like a bad person, he told her what he thought.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Brother, how do you have a heart for the throne? You are not…” Mu Tianxing did not expect that the always indifferent brother would even want to be emperor. It’s just that this kind of thinking is likely to bring them to death, the palace is a place where people are eaten without throwing up the bones, the two have lived hard enough here, but at least they are still alive, his idea is likely to push them to the land of no return.</p><p>“Xing’er, I understand your thoughts. So I have never told you that is brother’s wrong, and your brother should not think about getting something never belonged to him in the first place. In the future, I will not think about it again, let us calmly finish this life.” Twin brothers and sisters both have a heart and soul, growing up together, how could he not know what she thought?</p><p>Rolling her eyes in her heart, she felt that she had no sense of existence, being ignored by the twin brothers and sisters. “What are the both of you doing? Mu Tianri, I tell you, your thoughts are not delusions. You don’t have to stop your thinking, just think about what you want to do after you become the emperor.”</p><p>“Miss Yue,&nbsp;what is your intention?” Mu Tianri suspiciously looked at Yue Xin’er, as if trying to see through her.</p><p>“This, I want to talk to you alone. Tianxing, you go out and help us guard&nbsp;don’t let anyone close. This is a matter of your life. I don’t want you to hear this.” Because Mu Tianxing is too innocent, Yue Xin’er does not want her to know, first, she is afraid that she will accidentally spill this out, secondly, she does not want her to participate too much in this matter, so she uses this excuse to tell her to go elsewhere.</p><p>After Mu Tianxing went out, Yue Xin’er continued to say: “To tell you, I am Princess Gu Guo of the Jingyue Kingdom.” Although Mu Tianri was surprised, he not interject, Yue Xin’er continued, “You also know what kind of person your second brother is, sinister, and likes take advantage. I just came to Tian Xiang Kingdom by him, if he became an emperor, I am afraid that it will provoke war again, the people will not be able to continue living, this absolutely must not happen. Moreover, if you are worried about your elder brother, you don’t have to worry about it, we used to be together all the time, he told me that he had no interest in the throne. As long as you want to be emperor, I can help you ascend to the throne.”</p><p>“But, you are the princess of the Jingyue Dynasty, but what can you do to help me ascend the throne of Tian Xiang Kingdom?”</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about this. Since I promised to help you, then I will never say anything. As long as you are on the throne and can make a hundred-year contract with my Jingyue Kingdom, then you can rest easy.” One must know that she is not only a princess of golden branches and jade leaves, after the establishment of the Crescent Moon Palace, she sent many people to spies in various countries, no matter which class has her people, at the very top there are imperial court officials, down to the beggars on the streets, there are people of the Crescent Moon Palace.</p><p>*Golden branches and jade leaves: used to describe a well bred lady</p><p>“Okay, I am willing to form an alliance with you.” After thinking for a long time, Mu Tianri finally made up his mind.</p><p>In fact, Yue Xin’er has long seen that Mu Tianri has this idea, how many princes did not want to be the emperor? Not to mention that he has been bullied to this day since childhood. If a person has been oppressed, he will think about growing his influence. Although Mu Tianri has always been very low-key, when she looked into his eyes, she saw his desire for the throne and also saw his desire to show ambition. As far as she knows, Mu Tianri is a very talented person, and has a kind heart, since he wants to be an emperor, and he does not want Mu Tianlin to sit on the throne, he is the best candidate.</p><p>“Then, it’s a promise.” So, Yue Xin’er has made such an agreement with Mu Tianri.</p><p>Poor Mu Tianlin still doesn’t know that the woman he likes is trying to get rid of him with the younger brother he thought to be harmless! He could only blame himself, if he didn’t bring Yue Xin’er to Tian Xiang, she wouldn’t get to know Mu Tianri, and wouldn’t even have a deal with him. As the saying goes, everything that has its roots has fruit, if you plant something, you will bear fruit, let’s just that, he and the empress are blessed.</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>Chapter 10</strong></p><p>On the road, several men were riding on horses, leaving a trail of dust behind them, the leading man wore white robes embroidered with an unknown pattern on the cloth, the edges of the clothes lined with golden thread, the man was definitely one with a noble background. Looking at it again, the man’s handsome face was filled with deep worries, he was the eldest prince of the Tian Xiang Kingdom, Mu Tianchen.</p><p>“Mu Gongzi, has the palace lord really been taken to the Tian Xiang Kingdom?” asked a man in yellow, Huang Que of the seven gatekeepers.</p><p>“According to the sources, my second brother returned to the&nbsp;Tian Xiang Kingdom in a carriage half a month ago, but as far as I know, my second brother hates to ride a carriage, so it seems that he was with Yue Xin’er in the carriage bringing her to the&nbsp;Tian Xiang Kingdom.”</p><p>Nowadays, they are rushing to the Tian Xiang Kingdom. In a few days, they would arrive at the capital city of Tian Xiang Kingdom. Mu Tianchen is the eldest prince, as the eldest son, he also has his own quarters in the palace. But because he was afraid of hitting the grass and startling the snake, he didn’t know what to do at this moment. Lan Huang knew where his thoughts went, although to some extent, Mu Tianchen is his own rival, now, everything has been about the safety of Yue Xin’er. Plus, he always thought his identity was humble, not deserving of Yue Xin’er, and Mu Tianchen is better than himself in any aspect, this time he would get along, knowing that he loves Yue Xin’er more than himself, so he accepted it in his heart. Without much thought, everyone was arranged to live in the branch of the Crescent Moon Palace in the&nbsp;Tian Xiang Kingdom.</p><p>The group had been rushing for days, they were exhausted, but because they were worried about Yue Xin’er, they felt as if there was a baggage on their shoulders and quickly inquired the people of the branch for her news.</p><p>Seeing that everyone’s eyes are bloodshot, Lan Huang knows that looking for Yue Xin’er is not at a moment of urgency, they should all go to rest. Everyone looked at each other and understood that they could not rush for a while and went to rest in their own room.</p><p>As evening came, they woke up. Lan Huang asked the director of the branch whether there was news of Yue Xin’er, but director Wang said with a depressed face: “This subordinates sent people to search the entire capital, but there is no news of the palace lord.”</p><p>“Director Wang, you must first tell the servants to send dinner to the hall, I have things to say.” After the people excused themselves, Lan Huang said to the others: “It seems that Mu Tianlin brought the palace lord into the palace, tonight, we will enter the palace to see the situation. What do you think?”</p><p>“Okay. We wait until the third geng, then we will act. At that time, Lan Huang, Huang Que, and the Qing Niao will sneak into the palace with me. The less people enter the palace the better, so the others will stay outside the palace. If we are lucky, we will be able to save Yue Xin’er tonight.” Mu Tianchen made a decision, because he is still a prince, and he is familiar with the terrain of the palace. Lan Huang and the three of them have better lightness skill, so he chose them three to sneak into the palace.</p><ul><li>Third geng: Measurement of time with the night patrolman hitting the geng (ancient alarm clock/ wake up call), about midnight</li></ul><p>Seeing that everyone has no opinion, Director Wang had the servants send in with the dinner, everyone said no more, and wait until the third geng to take action.</p><p>The third geng soon came, several figures in black flashed across the street and finally stopped outside the palace wall. Once the patrolling army passed, Mu Tianchen made a gesture, and jumped onto the palace wall, seeing that there were no guards around, he waved to the people under the wall, they fluttered in following behind.</p><p>After they had entered the palace, they did not hesitate and went straight to Yulin Palace. On the way, they evaded several patrols guards and because their lightness skill was good, they did not let the guards discover their intrusion. After arriving at Yulin Palace, they found that Yulin Palace was divided into several pavilions and decided to split up. Lan Huang goes to the west, Huang Que goes to the south, Qing Niao goes to the north, and Mu Tianchen goes to the east where Mu Tianlin resides.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>After exploring several palaces, Mu Tianchen came to Tianyue Pavilion, he was crouched outside the window of Tianyue Pavilion, poking a hole through the paper window, as his eyes peered through the hole. In the beginning, there was only the sound of the water, covered in a white mist, he saw a woman leaning with her back facing him. He just wanted to see it carefully. Suddenly, he felt that a strong wind broke through the window and quickly ducked down. At a glance, it was a teacup that broke through the window. The person in the room was surprised because of the person peeking in.</p><p>“You peek through a window at a woman taking bath, how bold of you, why don’t you come in.” In the midst daydreaming, he heard the beautiful voice, he got excited and open the window and jumped in.</p><p>“Xin’er I finally found you, do you know how worried I was about you?” As soon as he jumped in, he draped his cloak on Yue Xin’er and held her his arms.</p><p>She thought that an assassin had entered the palace to assassinate someone, she did not think it would be Mu Tianchen, when she thought of how she had just hurt him, she was a little scared, but after thinking about it, he would come sooner or later, it’s just that she had just flirted with him while taking a bath, it’s good to take a cup and throw him. Just now, when she thought of how he might have seen other women take baths, she shoved him away. “You go away!”</p><p>Mu Tianchen saw her angry, thinking about it, knowing that she was unhappy because he accidentally saw her taking a bath, he quickly apologized, “Xin’er, don’t be angry, I did not deliberately peek at you during your bath. Besides, didn’t you just throw a teacup out? It almost hit me, you were going easy on me!”</p><p>“Hey, you still dare to say, if you did not unleash killing intent, I would not have thrown a teacup.” Yue Xin’er’s internal strength was high, at that time, only thirty percent was used, if she used her full strength, Mu Tianchen would have definitely been killed or injured.</p><p>“Right, Xin’er, how can you be alone? Where are the guards and palace ladies?” Seeing that she didn’t seem so angry, he quickly shifted the topic.</p><p>“Them? Because when I take a shower, I don’t like people nearby, so I drove them all away, otherwise, do you think that you could have made such a big move, without anyone catching you?” Then she looked around him and snickered. “However, you are the eldest prince of the Tian Xiang Kingdom it should be no problem if you are caught.”</p><p>Mu Tianchen looked at her helplessly,”You little girl, gossip less, or go out with me first! Your seven gatekeepers have followed me to the Tian Xiang Kingdom, you have disappeared this time, making everyone angry.”</p><p>As soon as I heard that the seven main gatekeepers were coming, Yue Xin’er’s face became a bit serious, the disaster in southern Mo had just picked up, but it was not because of her, had given up on the people. “How many people came? Did anyone stay in southern Mo?”</p><p>“You can rest assured that there are only five people who follow, Cheng Feng and Chi Wu are both staying in southern Mo, on the one hand, they continue to aid the disaster recovery, and on the other, continue to search for you.” Knowing that she is worried about the people in southern Mo, he told her the truth.</p><p>Knowing that someone stayed in southern Mo, her heart was at ease. Later, she asked about the situation of the Jingyue Kingdom, seeing that it was getting late, she said to Mu Tianchen: “Brother Chen, go back first. Tell them not to worry, I am not at risk here. I still have some things to do, and I will go back to you when I finish those things.”</p><p>“What else do you have? Now everyone is worried to death about you, I think you should return with me first if there is anything, we should get out of the palace first, I am not at ease with you staying here.” The palace is too sinister, although Yue Xin’er is also a princess, she did not grow up in the palace and did not touch the dirty schemes, she would not understand. Moreover, Mu Tianlin’s feelings for Xin’er also made him feel very uneasy, he always got what he liked, now he has taken Yue Xin’er to the&nbsp;Tian Xiang Kingdom, is there anything he doesn’t dare do?</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“No need to persuade me anymore, I have decided, I will go back when I am ready.” She doesn’t know if Mu Tianchen knows, but if he wants to participate in the battle for the throne he should know about it. But on the other hand, the fewer people know, the better, so she didn’t tell him. But she also knows that concealing matters is not a good thing. When the time is ripe, he will definitely be the first person she tells.</p><p>“Hey, I really don’t know what to say about you.” No one can stop it when Yue Xin’er has made her decision, although there are some concerns, he has to have her promise. “You have to promise me to protect yourself, tomorrow I will also return to the palace as the eldest prince, and I will be with you at that time.”</p><p>Mu Tianchen’s burning eyes stared at Yue Xin’er, she couldn’t help but lower her head. “You, why are you looking at me like this?”</p><p>After waiting for a long while, she did not hear him speak, she was suspicious whether he was gone or not, and looked up and found that she did not know when he had gotten closer. She stared blankly as his face as he approached her, and she couldn’t help but close her eyes. A light feathery kiss fell on her lips, her eyelashes twitched gently, feeling Mu Tianchen’s kiss deepening. After a long time, Mu Tianchen let go of her, both of them were so close to the opposite sex for the first time, and there was a faint red blush on her snow-like skin.</p><p>“Xin’er, I love you, wait for me. When this is over, will you marry me? We can look for a small island to live on, if you are tired of the island, we can come out and see the scenery, are you willing?” Mu Tianchen said affectionately.</p><p>“I… this thing has to be approved by my Emperor father and Empress mother, I can’t make the decision.” Yue Xin’er’s head lowered, she did not dare look at him. “You should be going back soon, the sky is going to be bright soon, don’t get discovered.”</p><p>“That’s good, you wait for me.” Mu Tianchen reluctantly printed a kiss on her forehead&nbsp;and then left.</p><p>Besides, the other three people, who have searched the Yulin Palace, have not found Yue XIn’er but the sun was going to rise soon, they quickly returned to the place where they had made appointments with the others. After waiting for a long while, there only Mu Tianchen had not arrived, but when everyone thought he was arrested and was about to look for him, he came back. Seeing that everyone has arrived, they will return to the branch of the Crescent Moon Palace.</p><p>As soon as they returned to the branch, several other people gathered around and asked about the situation of finding someone. Mu Tianchen saw that they were so concerned about Yue Xin’er, and could not decide if he should be envious or be happy. Envious that Yue Xin’er has so many people who care about her, but has none. Happy that Yue Xin’er has so many good subordinates and good friends, they care about her so much, and he is also happy for her.</p><p>“You don’t have to worry, I have found Xin’er, she is in Tianyue Pavilion.”</p><p>“Since you found the palace lord, why didn’t you bring her back?” Lan Huang is somewhat dissatisfied.</p><p>Mu Tianchen gave him a look. “She said that she has something to do, do you think I would be able to take her away if she doesn’t want to go?”</p><p>Everyone thought for a while and agreed, their precious palace lord always has ideas, as long as it is her decision, she must have her own reason, persuasion is useless. But they are also worried that she would be alone in a foreign place where people eat without vomiting the bones.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I will go back to the palace tomorrow and will not let her suffer.” Mu Tianchen looked at their expressions and knew what they were worried about.</p><p>Seeing that the sky is going to be bright soon, everyone is exhausted, knowing that Yue Xin’er is not in danger, and Mu Tianchen promised to go to the palace to protect her, everyone’s heart was at peace as they went to rest.</p><p>However, Lan Huang vaguely felt that something was wrong&nbsp;when Mu Tianchen met with them, he seemed to smell that Mu Tianchen had a fragrance that belonged to Yue Xin’er. He did not do anything to her, right? He, himself has been staying at Yue Xin’er’s side since he was ten years old, in the past ten years, the two have been together, saying that it is impossible to love her, although he is still not reconciled in his heart, as long as she is happy, no matter what she wants him to do, he would be willing. Even if he has a lot of pain in his heart, he will not tell her, so as to not cause her trouble. It seems that Mu Tianchen is braver than himself, at least he has the courage to express his feelings, maybe it will not take long before they drink the happiness wine. At that time, it will be the time for him to give up completely, and he will deeply bury this feeling in his heart, and then silently stay with her until his death.</p><ul><li>Happiness wine: Equivalent to marital wine, or Mu Tianchen and Yue Xin’er getting married</li></ul>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>Chapter 11</strong></p><p>The next day, Mu Tianchen said goodbye to the others and hurried to the palace. After the Emperor heard that his eldest son had returned, he was very happy and arranged to meet him in the royal study.</p><p>As soon as he entered the Xuan Yuan Hall, the Emperor ordered the servants to retreat, his face was filled with joy and he said, “Chen’er, you are back.”</p><ul><li>Chen’er: terms of endearment</li></ul><p>Mu Tianchen’s eyes were slightly red, he choked as he said: “Emperor father, this child is unfilial.”</p><p>The Emperor patted his shoulder and said: “Chen’er, you have suffered,” then he sat himself down, “We have not seen each other for a while, Chen’er is getting more and more handsome. How long will you stay this time?”</p><p>“Replying to Emperor father, Er Chen returned to protect a person. As for how long it will take, it will depend on her.” Mu Tianchen thought of Yue Xin’er as gentle smile floated on his lips.</p><ul><li>Er Chen: How a child of the imperial family refers to themselves; Subject son/ daughter</li></ul><p>“Oh? Could the person that Chen’er wants to protect be your sweetheart. What kind of woman is she?” Seeing the look on his son’s face, it seems that his heart has been moved, but he doesn’t know which family’s daughter his son has taken fancy of. However, he owes him a lot, even if he likes a courtesan, he would not object.</p><p>“Hehe, she is a kind, beautiful, and a talented woman can only be described as a woman unique in the world.” When mentioning his sweetheart, Mu Tianchen could not help but have his face filled gentleness.</p><p>“Unique woman? This is the first time you have praised a woman so highly. Zhen wants to see her. When will you bring her into the palace for Zhen to take a look!” This son has always been very self-sufficient, and would never put an average woman in the eyes. He has also chosen several beauties for him before, even the number one beauty in the capital was among them, and even she had never entered his eyes. Although he has been lingering in the flowers, he is in the middle of the flowers, and refuse to touch the leaves. Nowadays, he calls his sweetheart a unique woman, it seems that the woman must be a dragon among phoenixes, otherwise, it is impossible for her to enter his eyes. This made the Emperor curious.</p><p>“Emperor father, Er Chen’s sweetheart is in the palace.” Mu Tianchen simply points out, to prevent Yue Xin’er from getting harmed in the palace.</p><p>“In the palace?” The emperor tried guessing, “Is it a palace lady of Xin Jin Palace?”</p><p>Mu Tianchen felt helpless, “Emperor father, I haven’t returned for so long, these ladies should have been selected last month, right? How would I have time to get to know them?”</p><p>“This is true, could it be you fell in love with one of the palace’s consorts?” The emperor suddenly wondered.</p><p>In order not to let the Emperor from making more outrageous guesses, he simply openly told of the matter of Yue Xin’er. “Don’t guess anymore, Xin’er is the Princess Gu Guo of the Jingyue Kingdom. Because second brother also likes her, he kidnapped her to the Tian Xiang Kingdom.”</p><p>“What?” After hearing that Mu Tianlin actually kidnapped the little princess of the Jingyue Kingdom, the Emperor’s head began to hurt. Kidnapping the princess of a country, this matter can be big or small. If it is too big, Yue Xin’er in the Jingyue Kingdom, and even the rest of the whole world, it may cause great chaos in the world, it may even lead to an attack on the Tian Xiang kingdom and eventually led to the destruction of the Kingdom. Mu Tianlin does not know, does not mean that he does not know. This woman is the goddess foreseen five hundred years ago, if something happens to her, who knows how many disasters would occur. It is said that five hundred years ago, the world was in chaos, and the smoke was everywhere. Because a monk named Gan Xi was helped by the people of Wu, he began to fight for territory. The army led by the devotion of the people of Wu was like a broken bamboo, it was turbulent. Just when the formation of the last Kingdom, that is, the Jingyue Kingdom, the gods were defeated, the soldiers were defeated, and the people of Wu were all sealed. At that time, the head of the god soldier had left a godly scripture, saying that after five hundred years, the people of Wu would open the seal, bringing harm to the four directions, the goddess would protect the world. This matter will only be known when the kings throughout the ages that sat on the throne, fifteen years ago when Yue Xin’er was born, he knew that the goddess was born. Now Mu Tianlin is fascinated by desire and kidnapped the goddess to the Tian Xiang Kingdom, he really doesn’t know how can this be good. The more he thought about it, the worse his face became.</p><ul><li>People of Wu: Equivalent to witches or people with magical powers</li></ul><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Emperor father, what’s wrong? Do you need Er Chen to call a doctor?” Seeing that the Emperor’s face is not too good, and his body seemed to be shaking, he quickly stepped forward to help.</p><p>“Chen’er is Princess Gu Guo in Yu Lin Palace?” Seeing Mu Tianchen nod, the Emperor’s face paled, it seems that this Lin’er was spoiled by the Empress, not to mention the things the Empress did in the palace, he even knows what Mu Tianlin is also secretly doing. They thought that he knew nothing about these things, but how could he not know what they were doing in private. This time, he did such a big mistake, Mu Tianlin has disappointed him, the consequences are unimaginable. At this point, the Emperor had made a decision, “Chen’er, do you want to be the Emperor?”</p><p>“Emperor father, you…” Mu Tianchen looked at him with amazement.</p><p>“Chen’er, tell your father the truth.”</p><p>“Er Chen does not wish to be.” Mu Tianchen solemnly said.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Er Chen’s character is not suitable for being an emperor. Er Chen is only willing to live with the person I love for the rest of my life.” Mu Tianchen directly looked at the Emperor, his decision was firm.</p><p>After the Emperor listened, he said: “What Zhen feels the most regret towards in this lifetime is towards you and your mother, Zhen wants to compensate for you, are you unwilling to accept it?”</p><p>“No, I know that you pity me, but I really don’t want to be an Emperor. Have you not seen through the dirty schemes over the years? My mother has, therefore, become a victim of a political power struggle. I don’t want to encounter these things anymore, I know how you feel about me, I have never blamed you for my mother’s death, I only hate the people who were responsible for it, so I hope you won’t let me touch the things I hate the most.” For a moment, Mu Tianchen was on the ground, he didn’t even use honorifics, it was just like an ordinary son saying to his father what had always been buried deep in his heart.</p><p>The Emperor seemed to have aged a few years after listening, he said: “You get up first! Zhen understands. According to your opinion, who should the throne pass to? Your second brother is absolutely an impossible choice. In these years, he has seen you as an obstacle, he has sent people to assassinate you many times, now, he has kidnapped the princess of the Jingyue Kingdom to the Tian Xiang Kingdom, Zhen will not tolerate it.”</p><p>“What does Emperor father think of Mu Tianri?” Mu Tianchen stood up and said.</p><p>“This child is very low-key, Zhen doesn’t know how he is.” Knowing that Mu Tianchen is recommending someone to him, he seriously considers it, but he did not think of Mu Tianri. It seems that he really isn’t a competent father. “Chen’er, what do you know about your third brother?”</p><p>“Third brother is kind and benevolent, he has some means of doing things and is very careful, the ministers of the court also support him, if father can him cultivate well, he will be a generation of a great leader in the future.”</p><p>“This matter, Zhen will think over, you should return to Chen Xi Palace to rest!” The Emperor waved his hand tiredly.</p><p>“Er Chen will retreat.” Just when Mu Tianchen was about to return to Chen Xi Palace, he heard a faint breath, Mu Tianchen shot a few gold needles. But seeing the figure flashing quickly, heading in the other direction. Mu Tianchen chased after him, and the man turned his head and threw a few smoke balls. When the smoke cleared, the figure was gone. Seeing that not a single trace was left behind, Mu Tianchen was annoyed and punched a fake mountain, causing it to collapse, alerting the guards not far away. The guards rushed over and saw the eldest prince, they quickly asked: “Eldest prince, was there an assassin?”</p><p>“No, you will handle this.” Finished speaking, he walked away. Along the way, he thought of the black dressed man. Obviously, that person must have been sent by Mu Tianlin to eavesdrop, but the matter of Yue Xin’er being the princess of the Jingyue Kingdom and the matter of establishing the next Emperor are all important, if Mu Tianlin knows what will happen, there must be something he will plan, it seems that this matter is getting more and more complicated. Now he can only hope that Yue Xin’er to finish the matter earlier so that he can take her away from this palace of rumors earlier.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The Emperor was also worried about Yue Xin’er, after Mu Tianchen had just left, he sent someone to call for Yue Xin’er.</p><p>Yue Xin’er came to Xuanyuan Hall, at a glance she saw that the Emperor had been ill for a long time, without saying anything, not even doing the bow, she took the emperor’s hand.</p><p>Her movement scared the eunuch behind the Emperor, pulling a high pitched scream: “How dare you…” before he could say anything else, he was scared by Yue Xin’er’s cold and murderous look.</p><p>“You all retreat.” The Emperor was also shocked at first, but when he saw that she feeling his pulse, he calmed down, his heart was touched. This girl is a good woman, with a godly spirit, she is many times more beautiful than the first beauty of the capital, no wonder Chen’er will fall in love with her. More importantly, she has a kind heart, it seems that she will care about people. Seeing her brows gradually wrinkle up, he couldn’t help but ask: “Is there any problem with Zhen’s body?”</p><p>“Have you often felt dizzy, weak, and sometimes accompanied by angina?”</p><p>“Yes, how do you know? Is Zhen’s illness getting worse?”</p><p>“Illness? No, you are poisoned with gu.” Yue Xin’er said affirmatively.</p><ul><li>蠱 Gu: The traditional preparation of gu poison involved sealing several venomous creatures (e.g., centipede, snake, scorpion) inside a closed container, where they devoured one another and allegedly concentrated their toxins into a single survivor.</li></ul><p>“Gu?”</p><p>“Yes, it is a heart devouring gu. It lives in the blood of the human heart. The host does not have any abnormalities at first, after getting it, symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and angina may occur, generally, the doctor won’t be able to find out, it will only be considered to be anemia, in the later stage, the heart palpitations will invade with the heart, along with the internal organs, until it kills its host.” She told the Emperor everything in one breath.</p><p>After listening to these words, the Emperor was greatly angered: “Do you know who gave Zhen the gu?”</p><p>“Don’t you already have the answer at the bottom of your heart?” Yue Xin’er asked.</p><p>“It’s the Empress.” Only she will have the opportunity to implant the gu. It’s just that he can’t believe that she’s so vicious, unwilling to even let her husband go.</p><p>“I heard that when the Empress had not yet married to Tian Xiang, she had learned the martial arts according to the secret book of her ancestors, who knew what she did. Because the people of Wu were sealed five hundred years ago, their martial arts were lost.” Yue Xin’er said, “Since you are my uncle and the father of brother Chen, I will save you.”</p><p>“Can you get rid of the heart devouring gu?” The Emperor asked with uncertainty.</p><p>Yue Xin’er faintly smiled, “Whether or not I can, you already have the answer, don’t you? Since you know that I was brought by your second son, you must also know my identity, if there is an illness I cannot cure in this world, I am afraid no one can cure it.”</p><p>“Good! You are the person that Chen’er likes, Zhen believes you.” When the girl said this, her posture was that of striving to hold the world was exactly the same as that of his youth, it really made him like her more and more. How good it would be if she was his daughter! But if she becomes the wife of his most favored child, it would be even better.</p><p>“Your majesty, I am daring to ask you a question, I wonder if it’s okay?” Because she was also the princess of a country, it felt appropriate to address herself as anything else, so she simply used “I”.</p><p>“Xin’er, you don’t need to hold a ceremony. You are the person recognized by Chen’er, Zhen’s future daughter in law, you can call me Emperor father as Chen’er does. If you have any questions, just ask.”</p><p>The Emperor really like this beautiful and unrelenting girl, and naturally he will not care about etiquette, he can’t wait for her to marry Mu Tianchen.</p><p>“Oh,” She saw his face full of expectations, she could not bear to refuse him, so she called him “Emperor father.”</p><p>“Ha ha, Xin’er really is an obedient child.”</p><p>The Emperor smiled and even his eyes became a seam, when the joy was over, the Emperor also gave the jade ring worn on his finger to her.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Keep it, this ring is something Zhen keeps close, you can use it to deploy the guards stationed outside the Imperial City, you have to keep it well.”</p><p>“Emperor father, Xin’er can’t accept this gift, it’s too valuable.”</p><p>When she heard that this thing can mobilize the army, she felt that this was a sign of trouble, she thought of the time she received half of the jade that her Emperor father gave, causing her to take on the responsibility most of her life. That jade was originally half of the military power of the Jingyue Kingdom. When this falls in the hands of others, one can never ask for it back, but it has become a hot potato in her hands. She didn’t want to take another big trouble to go back and end up working for the rest of her life.</p><p>However, the Emperor put the jade finger in her hand and said in a strong tone: “Receive it, this is the gift of meeting from Emperor father to you.”</p><p>Dear God, how can someone be forced to accept a gift? Yue Xin’er’s heart was weak, but in order not to let the Emperor get angry, she reluctantly accepted it. “Emperor father, Xin’er wants to know who the candidate for inheriting the throne is?”</p><p>“What do you want to do with the information?”</p><p>Although she is the future Wang Fei Tian Xiang Kingdom, after all, she has not married yet, and now she is openly asking him about the matter of the future Emperor, it is not very suitable.</p><p>“Emperor father, you don’t have to worry. I just want to fulfill my responsibility as a goddess. You are the current monarch of Tian Xiang Kingdom. You must know my mission.” Although Yue Xin’er does not like the title of the goddess, it is best to use the identity of the goddess to force him to say his own thoughts.</p><p>“I originally wanted to make Chen’er the crown prince, but he did not want to, and recommended the third prince, Mu Tianri, Zhen does not understand the third prince, so Zhen does not know if this is a good choice.” Since she is the goddess, there is no reason for him to reject her question, after all, she is also here for the peace in the world.</p><p>Yue Xin’er took out a book from her clothes and handed it to the Emperor, “This is the information on the third prince. I have already investigated it. Of course, you can also find someone to investigate and look at it, compared with the second prince, I hope that the third prince can become a great Emperor.”</p><p>“Oh? You are the fiancee of Chen’er, why don’t you want him to be the Emperor? If he is an Emperor, you would be the Empress.” The Emperor wanted to hear what this child was thinking.</p><p>“Keke, what is so good about being Emperor? In these years have you ever felt happiness for one day? For me, as long as we are happy every day, that is enough. For a person, the greater the power, the higher the ability, the greater the responsibility. She has had enough of the feeling of being pressured to death. Brother Chen has already seen enough of those ugly faces for the sake of power.” Yue Xin’er smiled conceitedly. “If I am willing, the throne is not in my eyes, let alone a small position of Empress.”</p><p>“Ha ha ha, your little girl is really the person Chen’er likes, good, good!” After the laugh, the Emperor curiously asked, “What would you do if I chose the second prince?”</p><p>“One word, kill.” Yue Xin’er’s mouth has a hint of a faint smile, with a strong murderous intent in her eyes, the words spoken by her mouth are full of coldness.</p><p>“You…” she is obviously a pretty little girl, how can you say such vicious words, it also sounded very powerful?</p><p>“What? You can’t bear it? It is also right, after all, it’s your own son.” Yue Xin’er taunted with a cold smile, “Just the news of the goddess getting kidnapped leaks out…”</p><p>“Fine, Zhen knows what to do.” the Emperor sighed helplessly, “You are not safe in the Tian Xiang Kingdom, tomorrow you will go out with Chen’er, first go back to the Jingyue Kingdom to avoid the limelight!”</p><p>“Okay, Xin’er retreats.” After that, she returned to Yu Lin Palace.</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

Although the man in black managed to evade Mu Tianchen, who was tracking him, he did not do so without getting hurt. He dragged his injured body to Yu Lin palace and reported what he overheard Mu Tianlin. Once Mu Tianchen [Mu Tianlin; I think the author made a mistake.] heard the brother he hated returned, and the possibility of the Emperor establishing Mu Tianri as the crown prince, his face turned sullen.</p><p>“Master, this subordinate has one more thing to report.” Seeing the terrible look on Mu Tianlin’s face, the man in black could not help but tremble, but he still told what he overheard to Mu Tianlin. “This subordinate overheard the eldest prince say that you kidnapped Princess Gu Guo of the Jingyue Kingdom.”</p><p>“What? You said that Miss Yue is my little cousin Yue Xin’er?”</p><p>“Yes, this subordinate is sure there has been no mistake.”</p><p>“You go treat your wounds first.”</p><p>“This subordinate retreats.” After the man in black bowed in ceremony, he disappeared without a trace.</p><p>It turns out that Miss Yue is Yue Xin’er. No wonder she is so special, so it turns out she’s the cousin whose name is known all over the world. Now that she is by his side, it makes sense if they tie the knot, right? Moreover, he heard that her identity was not ordinary in the Jingyue Kingdom, and the marriage between the two kingdoms would be a great help to him in the future. If he tells this news to his Empress mother, who knows if she will be happy! The more he thinks of it, the happier he gets, the unhappy feeling brought to him from Mu Tianchen was soon forgotten, he quickly rushed to Chi Yue Palace where the Empress resides.</p><ul><li>嶽: Yuè (Mountains); Fake surname she uses. 月; Yuè (Moon); Her actual surname</li></ul><p>When he arrived at Chi Yue Palace, Mu Tianlin couldn’t wait to tell the Empress all the information he had received. Sure enough, the Empress also agreed with him as he thought, the Empress had never been happy that Mu Tianlin brought back a lowly woman from the&nbsp;Jingyue Kingdom, now she knows that the woman turned out to be her own niece, with a distinguished identity, after all, Yue Xin’er has a blood relationship with herself, and should help Mu Tianlin, if she wants Mu Tianlin to sit on the throne, and she is a princess of a country, once she is brought in, the throne will be at their fingertips.</p><p>“Lin’er, how is the relationship between you and Xin’er?”</p><p>“She is the same as always, ignoring Er Chen.” Speaking of this, Mu Tianlin had a look of annoyance, these days, no matter what he did, she didn’t even spare him a glance.</p><p>The Empress smiled sullenly “It doesn’t matter, let’s send someone to the Jingyue Kingdom to speak of the matter of marriage, Bengong does not believe that once she married, she will still act as a spoiled princess.”</p><ul><li>Bengong: How women of status in the palace refer to themselves.</li></ul><p>“Right, Er Chen will send people to prepare the gifts for tomorrow.” Both the mother and the child are accustomed to taking advantage of it, if it is not the easy way, then it will be the hard one.</p><ul><li>Gifts refer to the bride price, to compensate the family after no longer having their daughter</li></ul><p>“Lin’er, your elder brother does not agree with you, your Emperor father has not established the crown prince, you should quickly get rid of him. Your Emperor father has been poisoned by my heart devouring gu, it is estimated that he will only have a few days to live. You have to get rid of the dissidents, don’t let other people take advantage of it.” For this husband, she felt nothing for him, as for the Jingyue Kingdom, there was only endless resentment. That year, if her Emperor father had not forced her to marry to the Tian Xiang Kingdom and separate her from her beloved, how could she not poison him with gu? In order for revenge, she became what she is today.</p><p>“Yes, Er Chen understands.” Although the Emperor is his biological father, in order to be able to sit on the throne, he will use any means, block by the Gods, he will, kill, and kill Buddha when they meet.</p><p>On the other hand, Yue Xin’er returned to Yulin Palace, when several of the palace ladies saw her finally returning safely, they let out a sigh of relief. This master cannot be easily lost, the situation was urgent, and it was too late to report to the second prince. Plus, when Yue Xin’er left, she ordered them not to tell Mu Tianlin, if something really happened they could not afford it. After waiting for half an hour, they saw her coming back, just like the drowning people catching on to the straw. Mu Tianlin knew nothing about Yue Xin’er going to see the Emperor, at first, it was because the man in black came over and returned, later, he went to the Chi Yue Palace, naturally, he did not know that she had left the Yu Lin Palace.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Before Yue Xin’er returned, she pulled off the jade ring and hid it, she didn’t want Mu Tianlin to discover this. If he knows that this thing can mobilize the soldiers, it is estimated that he will immediately take it away and then rebel. However, the Emperor appointed the Jade to her, who was a foreigner, if she wanted to attack the Tian Xiang Kingdom, wouldn’t it be easy? It is good that she has no ambitions, or the Tian Xiang Kingdom will probably merge into the territory of the Jingyue Kingdom.</p><p>The following day, Yue Xin’er took the opportunity to find Mu Tianxing by going to Xing Chen Palace of, where Mu Tianxing resides. After entering the quarters, she sent away the palace servants behind her.</p><p>“XIn’er, how did you come?” Mu Tianxing just got up, and her voice was still full of drowsiness.</p><p>“Today, I will return to the Jingyue Kingdom today, there will be many things happening in Tian Xiang Kingdom after this, In my opinion, it would be safer if you go with me. If Mu Tianlin knows that Tianri will become the crown prince today, he will definitely capture you and threaten your brother, do you want to go with me?”</p><p>In order not to become cumbersome to Mu Tianri, the only way was to, follow Yue Xin’er to go to the Jingyue Kingdom to play, so, she simply agreed.</p><p>The palace gates were opened, with her lightness skills, she bypassed countless guards with Mu Tianxing, without a soul knowing, they arrive at Chen Zi Palace. As soon as she entered the door, she saw that Mu Tianchen was waiting for them, Yue Xin’er looked at him with a smile, and the two seemed incomparable, Mu Tianxing looked at the pair with envy.</p><p>“Eldest imperial brother, the feelings between you two are very good, your little sister is envious to death.” Mu Tianxing slyly teased the couple, she then really saw Yue Xin’er blushing a shade of red.</p><p>“Enough, Xing’er, don’t tease, didn’t you see, her face is already red.” Mu Tianchen looked at Mu Tianxing with a funny smile, this girl, when was she was so courageous, daring to ridicule him.</p><p>“Hey, I haven’t married you yet! What are you saying?” Yue Xin’er’s blush could move a person.</p><p>Although Mu Tianchen likes to tease her, he also likes to look at her shy face, but it is impossible to get her angry.</p><p>And now it is imperative to send them both out of the palace, looking at the sky, it is not too early, he let them sit on the carriage that was prepared early, telling them to wait for his subordinate, who acted as a driver, then he also joined them.</p><p>When the carriage arrived at the gate of the palace, it was stopped by the guards who guarded the gate, Mu Tianxing’s hands nervously tighten around Yue Xin’er’s. Yue Xin’er’s expression has no fluctuations&nbsp;because she knows that Mu Tianchen has taken care of this matter. Sure enough, after a while, she felt that the carriage was moving again.</p><p>Out of the palace gate, the carriageway went straight toward the gate of the city, about an incense stick later, the carriage stopped. After Mu Tianchen took the lead in the carriage, Yue Xin’er also stuck out her head to explore, looking around, obviously, they were already in the suburbs. After all three of them got off the carriage, Mu Tianchen took them to a nearby farm.</p><p>There is nothing special about this farmhouse, but after she entered it, she realized that the sparrows were small and complete. Although there is no grand palace, it is quiet and pleasant, bringing in a new feeling.</p><p>“Older brother, why did you bring us here?” Because they were away from the palace, in order to not expose his identity, Mu Tianxing called Mu Tianchen older brother.</p><p>“You will stay here.” Mu Tianchen said.</p><p>“Then what about you and Xin’er?”</p><p>“I will bring Xin’er to return to the Jingyue Kingdom.”</p><p>“No, I want to go to Jingyue with you.” To say it beautifully, didn’t you just want to be alone with Xin’er? You want to leave me alone, no way.</p><p>“Tianxing, you stay here! I have a hunch, we will meet with bad things on the way back to the Jingyue Kingdom, in order to protect your safety, you will stay here. You can rest assured that I will send someone to protect you. Besides, you have to help keep an eye on your brother’s business.” Yue Xin’er opened her mouth and said. Last night, she once had a glimpse of this trip, and it seems there would be a&nbsp;big obstacle, full of blood, if it was just her and Mu Tianchen, it may be avoided.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“I…” Mu Tianxing grievously screamed, wanting to say something, but seeing Yue Xin’er’s face, she thoughtfully swallowed the rest of her words.</p><p>“Xing’er, you are staying here, don’t go out of the farm. Just wait for our news.” Finished speaking, he told a servant to take good care of Mu Tianxing, bringing some dry food and water, then he brought Yue Xin’er and got on the carriage.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Yue Xin’er asked Mu Tianchen: “Why are you not asking me why I stayed in the palace?”</p><p>Mu Tianchen took her shoulder and smiled, “Your husband, I know&nbsp;you very well, I naturally know what you want to do.”</p><p>Yue Xin’er shook off his hand and said disdainfully: “You are really not serious, was it your Emperor father who call you after he looked for me yesterday?”</p><p>“Yeah, Emperor father called me last night, he told me to bring you and Xing’er out of the palace early in the morning, it seems that this time Tian Xiang Kingdom cannot avoid a big storm.” Although he really doesn’t want to manage these things, this matter is related to his Emperor father and younger brother, no matter what the results are, it is probably not very good.</p><p>“Okay, don’t worry, although your second brother has done so many things that hurt the world, he is your brother and my cousin if he doesn’t do anything that makes me angry, I will not kill him. Tianri, along with your father will not kill him due to their blood relationship.” Knowing what he was worried about, but Mu Tianlin is not a good person, at this point, she has to make a decision.</p><p>After a few days of rushing, they finally reached the border between the Jingyue Kingdom and the&nbsp;Tian Xiang Kingdom, the three people on the carriage were relieved. These days, the three people have not eaten a good meal, and have not had a good night’s sleep. Now that they have finally reached the border, they could be considered half safe. After being on the carriage for a long time, their backs hurt. Mu Tianchen saw that Yue Xin’er’s face was not so good, so the driver brought the carriage to the side of the road and prepared to rest for a while before crossing the border.</p><p>Seeing that there is a small lake not far away, Yue Xin’er looked at Mu Tianchen with hopeful eyes, after getting his permission, she rushed over. She has not taken a shower in the past few days&nbsp;before she went to sleep, she would only wipe her body. Although she loves cleanliness, she has no complaints, but she still feels a bit awkward always feeling itchy. Now that she is at the border, she can say that they are safe for the time being&nbsp;when she sees this clear water, how can she stop herself from wanting to take the bath?</p><p>She took off her clothes, using the tip of her toes to test the temperature of the water, it was cool, not too icy, so she jumped in happily. Mu Tianchen stayed in the distance, hearing the sound of her jumping into the lake, he could not help but smile. This girl is really easy to satisfy, and he has not seen her so happy for a long time. When the matter of Tian Xiang Kingdom has come to an end, he would like to propose to the Jingyue Kingdom, he really couldn’t wait to see her become his own bride.</p><p>Yue Xin’er swam in the lake and played with the little fish in the lake, it was very comfortable. When she was having fun, she heard Mu Tianchen call out to her, it seems that a group of people came to the lake. Yue Xin’er’s heart didn’t come to a panic, an ominous premonition shrouded her, she quickly put on her clothes and flew away in the direction of Mu Tianchen.</p><p>Before I arrived at Mu Tianchen’s side, she saw a group of soldiers wearing armor rushing to her with Mu Tianlin. Mu Tianchen was half kneeling on the ground, his hair covering his face, she did not know how he was. Yue Xin’er hurriedly ran over to help him, she saw an arrow in his body, the wound was bleeding profusely with black blood apparently the arrow had poison.</p><p>“Brother Chen!” Yue Xin’er was shocked and quickly took out a porcelain bottle to put a greenish pill into his mouth. The toxicity of this poison is too strong, even the “Sacred heart Dan” that solves the poison can only temporarily suppress the toxicity, it is imperative to find a safe place to settle him down and find the method of detoxification. After Mu Tianchen ate “Sacred heart Dan”, he temporarily passed out.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>At this time, Mu Tianlin had brought the soldiers to the front of Yue Xin’er. “Little cousin, go back to the palace with your cousin! I have prepared the bride price, and tomorrow I will personally bring it to the Jingyue Dynasty to propose to your family.”</p><p>“Shut up!” The wrath of Yue Xin’er at this time cannot maintain the usual coldness indifference, just when she took Mu Tianchen’s pulse, she found that this poison is actually mixed with gu, apparently, it is his masterpiece of the vicious aunt. She was so disgusted with Mu Tianlin, and now he has hurt her lover, the new hatred and the old enmity, she cannot wait to kill him. “Hand over the antidote, if brother Chen is hurt in any way, I will have all of you buried along.”</p><p>Mu Tianlin may have been fascinated by her beautiful face, he did not hear the coldness in her words, instead, the soldiers who followed him felt that the surrounding temperature seemed to drop to the extreme.</p><p>Mu Tianlin saw that Yue Xin’er actually got angered for Mu Tianchen’s sake, and the fire in his heart Burst, “Stop, do not think of it, I won’t give you the antidote, I just want him to die!”</p><p>“You… very good!” Yue Xin’er was extremely angry and laughed after the words were finished, her body flashed one could only see her white clothes flying, it was only a moment, and she returned to her original place.</p><p>Mu Tianlin looked back and saw all the soldiers behind him were bleeding from all seven orcrafices and died.</p><p>He looked at her with suspicion, for the first time, he felt that he had met a person who shouldn’t be provoked. “What have you done?”</p><p>“If you don’t hand over the antidote, you will be like them.” Yue Xin’er smiled coldly, before she was like a fairy, now she is like a demon from hell.</p><p>“The antidote is not on me.” Under the cold eyes of Yuexin, Mu Tianlin could not help but tremble and told the truth involuntarily.</p><p>“Tell me, where is the antidote?”</p><p>“Even if I die, I won’t say!” Who knows where his courage came from, Mu Tianlin viciously stared at Mu Tianchen who was on the ground, “He deserves to die! If it weren’t for him, Emperor father would not make Mu Tianri the crown prince, if it weren’t for him, you wouldn’t be like this to me.”</p><p>“Stop! Let me tell you, even without him, your father will not choose you as the crown prince, do you think that what you usually do is not known to your father? What if I tell you that I am also the reason you were not chosen as the crown prince, what would you do? Hahaha… You won’t give me the antidote, I will destroy all your meridians and make you a waste.”</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

Yue Xin’er is angry and looks at the person who was obstructing her. She wanted to see who was so courageous but didn’t expect it to be her master, Yun Zhongzi, who had traveled all over the world.</p><p>“Master, why do you want to stop your disciple from breaking his meridians, do you know him…” When Yue Xin’er saw her master, who she had not met for a long time, the grievances in her heart were like the flood, and she could not help but allow a thick layer of watery&nbsp;mist come to her eyes.</p><p>“Xin’er, don’t cry.” The voice came from a man and a woman, As soon as Yue Xin’er looked up, she saw a couple about 30 to 40 years old coming towards her.</p><p>“Father Emperor, Empress Mother, you came.” The middle-aged couple is the one who is irresponsible for abdicating and giving the throne to her younger third brother.</p><p>We use to travel with your master, we heard you got kidnapped to the&nbsp;Tian Xiang Kingdom, so we came. Later, when I arrived at the&nbsp;Tian Xiang Kingdom we heard from your director that you were on your way to Jingyue, and then followed them to the border to prepare to meet with you. When we arrived here, we found your carriage at the side of the road, the driver has been dead. We estimated that you might have encountered trouble, thus, we rushed over.”</p><p>Father Emperor, Empress Mother, Mu Tianlin, he injured brother Chen, I have no way to treat the poison Gu on his body, what should I do?” Yue Xin’er whimpered and said with helplessness, her face made everyone feel heartbroken.</p><p>On the spot, a few of the masters who came with the Grand Emperor and the Grand Empress wanted to rush towards Mu Tianlin to turn him into a corpse, they had not seen Yue Xin’er’s in a few years. Yun Zhongzi had already pressed Mu Tianlin’s acupuncture points, and he was taking Mu Tianchen’s pulse.</p><p>“Master, Brother Chen’s poison Gu, can you treat it?” Yue Xin’er anxiously asked, although her medical skills surpassed Master a few years ago, she still had a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Yun Zhongzi sighed, “With your medical skills, I believe you know his situation. Now we don’t have any medicinal materials at all. Here, we are still in a remote place. His poison can only be dragged for up to 6 days. It is obviously too late to dispense medicine. For the sake of the present, you can only try to save his life by using the huan hun dan. You will return to the Palace with Mu Tianlin, and force the Empress to hand over the antidote. We will also rush to meet you as soon as possible.”</p><p>“Good, gatekeepers, you will protect them with my Father Emperor, Mother Empress, and brother Chen. I will take Mu Tianlin and get the antidote now.” As soon as she heard that Mu Tianchen could be saved, Yue Xin’er was busy giving orders.</p><p>“Palace lord, let us go with you!” Lan Huang said.</p><p>“No need, I have to bring him back to Yan city in three days, if I brought you, I’m afraid it will delay my time. If it is for me, just do what I say.” After that, she grabbed Mu Tianlin and pulled him onto the horse. She looked at Mu Tianchen with eyes full of love, then she looked toward Yan city, setting off.</p><p>By the third day, they finally returned to Yan city, both of them were unable to endure anymore. Although Yue Xin’er is well informed on the road, she was still worried about Mu Tianchen, so she ended up neglecting herself. Looking at Mu Tianlin, he no longer had the demeanor of a prince, his once handsome face was as haggard as a beggar’s.</p><p>They arrived at the palace gates, but were stopped by the guards once more. At this time, Yue Xin’er had no extra time to deal with them, with a wave of her sleeves, she sealed their acupoints. She rushed straight toward Chi Yue Palace.</p><p>Along the way, Mu Tianlin had hoped he would be rescued by the guards, but who knew that Yue Xin’er would take out the jade ring given by the Emperor, no one even dared to stop her. Mu Tianri and the Emperor heard that Yue Xin’er had returned, they felt that it was strange that she had gone to Chi Yue Palace, and hurriedly rushed over.</p><p>When they arrived, Yue Xin’er had been dragging Mu Tianlin to the Empress for a long time, and both sides were unwilling to give in. The guards surrounded them in the middle but did not dare to act. Both sides were in a deadlocked.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Aunt, please hand over the antidote.” Yue Xin’er said coldly. If she didn’t see the woman before her as her aunt, she would have torn her face to teach her a lesson.</p><p>“How dare you, let go of Lin’er, or else Bengong will have you executed.” When the Empress had seen her son in Yue Xin’er’s hand, she was a little confused, she had to use threats to cover up the unsettling tension in her heart.</p><p>“Stop, I respect you as my aunt, which is why I’m willing to waste time talking to you right now. If it was not for brother Chen’s life in danger, I would not come to see you. Quickly hand over the antidote, or I will destroy your son’s meridians in front of you.” Not accepting the wine toast, but drinking the wine of punishment. Seeing that the Empress was not willing to hand over the antidote, Yue Xin’er was not willing to waste time with her.</p><p>*Not accepting the wine toast, but drinking the wine of punishment; Not doing things the easy way, but the hard way</p><p>“You dare!” The Empress was shocked.</p><p>“Give it a try and you will know.” Yue Xin’er said with a cruel smile, like a swift thunderstorm, a palm went toward Mu Tianlin’s, severing the meridians in his arms, she then looked at the Empress with a provocative look.</p><p>Mu Tianlin’s screams resounded throughout the palace, Yue Xin’er’s move shocked everyone. After hearing his screams, they came back to their senses.</p><p>“Very noisy.” Yue Xin’er said as she pressed Mu Tianlin’s mute acupoint.</p><p>“Xin’er, what did you say about Chen’er?” At the side, the Emperor, after listening for a while raised an eyebrow and asked, he didn’t think that something had befallen to his favorite eldest son.</p><p>“Father Emperor, it’s this woman,” Yue Xin’er said, pointing to the Empress, and her face was angry. “It was her and her son who had inflicted brother Chen with poison Gu, now his life and death are uncertain. I returned to get the antidote from her.”</p><p>When the Empress saw the Emperor, she quickly asked for help: “Your Majesty, please save Lin’er!”</p><p>“Shut up, you Vile woman.” As soon as he heard that his most beloved son was tortured by that woman, the Emperor was so angry that he trembled, “You are going to give Xin’er the antidote.”</p><p>“Your Majesty…” The Empress looked at him earnestly, seeing that he refused to look at her when she looked towards him. Seeing her son on the ground, filled with cold sweat. After thinking, she decided to&nbsp;hand over the antidote, she threw two porcelain bottles toward Yue Xin’er, “This white porcelain bottle contains the antidote, the purple porcelain bottle contains the mother gu, return Lin’er to me.”</p><p>Yue Xin’er was delighted to pick up the porcelain bottle, she suddenly felt a numbness in her hand. She knew that something was wrong, quickly pushing the acupuncture point on her right hand, she took out a Sacred Heart Dan and swallowed it, full of anger: “Good, you poisonous woman, at this time you actually dare to hurt me, I finally know who I am looking for. I can finally complete my mission.”</p><p>Seeing that Yue Xin’er was not poisoned, the Empress had a strange look on her face, she then laughed and said: “Ha ha ha, I should have expected that the poison could not hurt you, and the title of the goddess is worthy of its fame.”</p><p>“Oh, since you are not benevolent, you will blame me for being unjust.” After the speech, Yue Xin’er’s palm went to Mu Tianlin’s head, he did not have enough time to dodge and was killed by her.</p><p>“Yue Xin’er, you are deceiving too much!” The Empress witnessed the kill, after all, which mother can witness her own biological son die in front of her can still remain calm?</p><p>The Emperor looked at their mother and son intricately, he opened his mouth, in the end, he remained silent.</p><p>“The roots of the grass is not removed, when comes spring it is reborn again.” Yue Xin’er ridiculed with a smile, “Don’t worry, you will soon see him.” After a pause, she then went on to say: “Now, let’s discuss something interesting, such as the identity of the Empress.”</p><p>It turned out that in the chaos of the five hundred years ago when the people of Wu were sealed, at that time the young masters of the people of Wu escaped in the chaos when they escaped, they had changed their identities, got married and had children. Because the people of Wu were not blessed by the gods, they did not have many offspring. In addition, the people of Wu have a characteristic that only women can study witchcraft and martial arts at the same time. For nearly five hundred years, because each generation only gave birth to a few boys, no girl was born, so they could not accept witchcraft and the inheritance of the martial arts so that the people of Wu had no way to unlock the seal. Thirty years ago, the people of Wu finally gave birth to a girl, her name was Wu Yue. At that time, the sacrificial priest knew that there would be a goddess born in the Jingyue Kingdom, and he planned to place the witch Wu Yue into the Jingyue Kingdom. All the plans were seamless&nbsp;after the goddess is born, she would take her power and get rid of her. Who knew that the people do not plan as well as the gods, in that year, Wu Yue slipped out of the palace, she fell in love with a handsome merchant, marrying him. The Emperor at that time, Yue Xin’er’s grandfather, naturally could not allow his precious daughter to be with a lowly merchant. When the Tian Xiang Kingdom requested a marriage, the Emperor would use Wu Yue’s sweetheart to lure her to the&nbsp;Tian Xiang Kingdom to get married. Wu Yue had always blamed the father of the Tian Xiang Kingdom’s Emperor&nbsp;but did not know that her own lover had seen money and sold her out for the sake of prosperity. After Wu Yue married into the Tian Xiang Kingdom, the people of Wu found her again and conspired with her. Since she had left the Jingyue Kingdom, there was no way to wait for the goddess to be born according to the original plan. Therefore, they would have to start from the&nbsp;Tian Xiang Kingdom, if the Emperor of the Tian Xiang Kingdom is on their own, then the day of the resurrection of the people of Wu is just around the corner. After that, Wu Yue agreed to Mu Tianlin chasing after Yue Xin’er, because she also remembered the original plan to win the power of the goddess. But, in the end, they had underestimated her and were defeated.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Wu Yue, as of now do you have anything to say?” Yue Xin’er looked at her with no expression, although the woman lived a pitiful life, her mission was to prevent the people of Wu from returning. In any case, she could not allow Wu Yue to live.</p><p>“I have nothing to say, I really didn’t expect that I have been looking for the wrong person in revenge for so many years. Hahaha, I am stupid. Now I have nothing, no more…” For a time, Wu Yue’s thoughts were gray, she had persisted for so many years. In exchange for the betrayal of her lover, it was the tragic death of her son. What is the meaning of living? She then swallowed the poison. Stunned, Wu Yue’s mouth spurted black blood, she slowly crawled to Mu Tianlin’s side, holding his hand, muttering in her mouth: “Lin’er, Mother Empress is coming to accompany you.” Finally with a smiled she closed her eyes.</p><p>Everyone quietly looked at this scene in front of them. It was all too sudden, no one could process it, and no one dared to stop it. The body of the Emperor was not good at all, and he lost a son and wife on the eve of the night. The other son was still unaccounted for. The series of blows made him faint again. From the beginning to the end, Mu Tianri did not speak, his eyes looked at Yue Xin’er for a long time, the eunuch and the palace lady ended up helping the Emperor back to the palace to rest. The guards lifted the bodies of Mu Tianlin and Wu Yue, they came to Yue Xin’er’s side.</p><p>“Every day, starting today, you will send people to search for the traces of the people of Wu, if you see one kill one, don’t leave one living. I will go to save your big brother first, we will meet again.” Yue Xin’er cupped her fist, in a flash, her figure had already disappeared.</p><p>Mu Tianri was dazed by her departure, he did not come to his senses after a while. Since he first saw her, he was attracted by her unique temperament. In fact, he did not have much ambition for the throne, he just pretended to like power because he was able to use this excuse to get close to her. Although she never said it, every time she talked about the tenderness of his eldest brother, he could see her love for his older brother. After Wu Yue killed their mother, he wanted to take revenge, since she also hopes that she can sit on the throne, he will do it! Now Wu Yue is dead and everything is over. Xin’er ah, I will be a good Emperor, you must be happy, Mu Tianri secretly gave them his blessing in his heart.</p><p>Away from Yan city, Yue Xin’er was rushing on the road when Ma Xianglai came, because she knew that time will not wait for people, instead of waiting for them to come back, it is better to go back&nbsp;so that at least half the time can be shortened.</p><p>While Mu Tianri was following the instructions of Yue Xin’er and started eradicating the people of Wu.</p>    \n        If you find any errors ( Ads popup, ads redirect, broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible. \n\n</div>"

		"content": "<div id=\"chapter-content\" class=\"chapter-c\"><p><strong>End</strong></p><p>Legend has it that in the vast sea, there is a place called Chen Xin Island. The people on that island are mysteriously abnormal. Outsiders that want to go to the island are always stopped by the thick white fog. In the end, no one can get to the island. It is said that the people living on this island are immortals, the man is handsome, while the woman is beautiful. The passing ships often hear the qin and singing, and the music is heavenly and lingers around for three days. Once, the Wulin lord had not yet ascended to his position of lord. He was chased by his enemies. After he was seriously injured, and fell into the sea he was rescued by the immortals, he learned martial arts, ascending to the position of Wulin lord. It is also rumored that the immortals on the island like to travel around and see the people who are in need help, lending a hand.</p><p>The people who live on the island are naturally Yue Xin’er and Mu Tianchen. Since Mu Tianchen’s health was good, he got the approval of the parents and Master of Yue Xin’er, they got married. Then they took a group of people to live on the Chen Xin island. Shortly after Yue Xin’er’s departure, the Emperor of Tian Xiang Kingdom announced that he would abdicate to the third prince. Since then, he has not been asked about the world, he was received by Mu Tianchen to share his family’s happiness. After Mu Tianri ascended the throne, he was known as the Sheng Yue Emperor, since then, the Tian Xiang Kingdom has entered a new, prosperous age. The Ling family framed by Mu Tianlin were cleared of all charges by Yue Feng. Entering the period of the Dasu era, the Jingyue Dynasty entered its heyday. The people of Wu were killed off because they greatly offended Yue Xin’er, and since then they have completely disappeared from history.</p><p>The year Yue Xin’er got married, Yue Ling was pregnant with her first child, Yue Xin’er diagnosed that the fetal position was incorrect when she was at her seventh month, so she stayed until the child was born. Nine months later, because of a fall, Yue Ling had a premature birth. Because of the position of the child, it was a difficult birth.
